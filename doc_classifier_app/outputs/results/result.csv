0,"b""Pernod takeover talk lifts Domecq\n\nShares in UK drinks and food firm Allied Domecq have risen on speculation that it could be the target of a takeover by France's Pernod Ricard.\n\nReports in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times suggested that the French spirits firm is considering a bid, but has yet to contact its target. Allied Domecq shares in London rose 4% by 1200 GMT, while Pernod shares in Paris slipped 1.2%. Pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics.\n\nPernod's last major purchase was a third of US giant Seagram in 2000, the move which propelled it into the global top three of drinks firms. The other two-thirds of Seagram was bought by market leader Diageo. In terms of market value, Pernod - at 7.5bn euros ($9.7bn) - is about 9% smaller than Allied Domecq, which has a capitalisation of \xc2\xa35.7bn ($10.7bn; 8.2bn euros). Last year Pernod tried to buy Glenmorangie, one of Scotland's premier whisky firms, but lost out to luxury goods firm LVMH. Pernod is home to brands including Chivas Regal Scotch whisky, Havana Club rum and Jacob's Creek wine. Allied Domecq's big names include Malibu rum, Courvoisier brandy, Stolichnaya vodka and Ballantine's whisky - as well as snack food chains such as Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins ice cream. The WSJ said that the two were ripe for consolidation, having each dealt with problematic parts of their portfolio. Pernod has reduced the debt it took on to fund the Seagram purchase to just 1.8bn euros, while Allied has improved the performance of its fast-food chains.\n""",business,business
1,"b'Qwest may spark MCI bidding war\n\nUS phone company Qwest has said it will table a new offer for MCI after losing out to larger rival Verizon, setting the scene for a possible bidding war.\n\nMCI accepted a $6.75bn (\xc2\xa33.6bn) buyout from telecoms giant Verizon on Monday, rejecting a higher offer from Qwest. Qwest chairman Richard Notebaert sent a letter to MCI\'s board on Thursday saying that it plans to submit a new offer after examining Verizon\'s bid. Formerly known as Worldcom, MCI is a long-distance and corporate phone firm. Snapping up MCI would give the buyer access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. Shares of MCI were up more than 4% in electronic trading after the close of New York markets.\n\nQwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn. ""We would like to advise you that once we have completed our review of the Verizon merger agreement, we do intend to submit a modified offer to acquire MCI,"" the letter from Qwest said. Verizon\'s offer is made up of cash, shares and dividends, and a number of investors have said that it undervalues MCI. Verizon plans to swap 0.41 of its shares and $1.50 in cash for each MCI share, as well as offering special dividends of $4.50 a share. Both company boards have backed the deal, but regulators will still need to give their approval. As well as trying to lure investors with the promise of better returns, Qwest also reckons that its offer will face less regulatory scrutiny than Verizon\'s.\n\nThe takeover would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. Earlier this month, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. There may be concerns other than cash, however, especially as MCI only emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. Verizon is far bigger than Qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. Also, MCI, while trading under the name Worldcom, became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in US history after admitting that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently standing trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest, meanwhile, had to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it massaged earnings to keep Wall Street happy.\n'",business,business
2,"b'Dogged Federer claims Dubai crown\n\nWorld number one Roger Federer added the Dubai Championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by Ivan Ljubicic.\n\nTop seed Federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed 6-1 in the first set. But Ljubicic, who beat Tim Henman in the last eight, dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. Swiss star Federer was not about to lose his cool, though, turning on the style to win the deciding set 6-3. The match was a re-run of last week\'s final at the World Indoor Tournament in Rotterdam, where Federer triumphed, but not until Ljubicic had stretched him all the way. ""I really wanted to get off to a good start this time, and I did, and I could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm,"" Federer said.\n\n""That took me all the way through to 6-1 3-1 0-30 on his serve and I almost ran away with it. But he came back, and that was a good effort on his side."" Ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set. ""I didn\'t start badly, but then suddenly I felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much. And with Roger, if you relax for a second it just goes very quick,"" he said. ""After those first three games it was no match at all. I don\'t know, it was really weird. I was playing really well the whole year, and then suddenly I found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court."" But despite his defeat, the world number 14 was pleased with his overall performance. ""I had a chance in the third, and for me it\'s really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against Roger to win the match. ""It\'s an absolutely great boost to my confidence that I\'m up there and belong with top-class players.""\n'",sport,sport
3,"b'Oscars race enters final furlong\n\nThe race for the Oscars entered its final stages as the deadline for voters to choose their winners passed.\n\nThe 5,808 Academy voters had until Tuesday afternoon to return their ballots - any late submissions will not be included in the count. The next five days will be spent counting the voting forms and preparing the winners\' envelopes. Best actor nominee Leonardo DiCaprio is to present a statuette for the first time at the LA ceremony on Sunday.\n\nThe 30-year-old actor, who is nominated for playing Howard Hughes in The Aviator, will join other hopefuls such as co-star Cate Blanchett, Natalie Portman and Kate Winslet as Oscar presenters. The only people who will know the Oscar winners before they are revealed at the ceremony will be the auditors who are in charge of looking after the ballot count.\n\nAfter collating the results, they are responsible for sealing the results in the famous golden envelopes which will be revealed by a host of celebrity presenters at the ceremony. Former Academy Award winners Gwyneth Paltrow, Dustin Hoffman and Halle Berry will also present prizes. The event at the Kodak Theatre will be attended by 3,300 people, including some of the best-known names in film, and organisers say they expect it will be watched on television by one billion people around the world. One current concern is the torrential rain which has lashed Los Angeles for the past week, flooding suburbs and causing mudslides. It is hoped the forecast for Sunday, for cool weather but no rain, will prove accurate. ""The last time it rained on Oscars night was in the mid-to-late 1980s,"" said Oscars communications director John Pavlik. ""We have had rain up until the day before the show many times, but for some reason the Oscar gods always shine on Sunday and we hope they will do so again this year,"" he added.\n'",entertainment,entertainment

In the other Group B game Cameroon's\n\nbeat\n\nof South Africa 3-2 in Douala, neither side could have qualified for the final. Hearts of Oak started the game needing a win to qualify for the final while Cotonsport only needed to avoid defeat to go through. Louis Agyemang scored the first two goals for Hearts either side of half time before Ben Don Bortey scored the third. Hearts looked set for a comfortable win but Cotonsport staged a late fight back scoring twice late on. First of all Boukar Makaji scored in the 89th minute and then 3 minutes into injury time at the end of the game Andre Nzame III was on target. But it was too little too late for the Cameroonians and Hearts held on to win the game and a place in the final. The first leg of the final will be played in Accra on the weekend of 27-28 November and the second leg two weeks later on the 11 December in Kumasi. In the other Group B game Cameroon's Sable Batie took the lead in the 35th minute through Kemadjou before Santos equalised on the hour mark thanks to Thokozani Xaba . Bernard Ngom put Sable ahead just five minutes later and then Ernest Nfor settled the game on 68 minutes.

""This was a band that wanted to lay claim to this world and the next one, too,"" said Springsteen. Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr, who formed U2 at school in 1977, begin a world tour on 28 March. Introducing the band, Springsteen mocked Bono as the man who ""single-handedly pioneered the Irish mullet"", poking fun at ""one of the best and most endearingly messianic complexes in rock \'n\' roll"". But he also spoke of the group\'s enduring stature, adding that it was the only band of the last 20 years where he knew all four members\' names.\n\nU2\'s contemporaries, the Pretenders, led by Chrissie Hynde - took to the stage to perform My City Was Gone with inductee Neil Young. ""We are a tribute band,"" said Hynde, 53. ""We\'re paying tribute to James Honeyman-Scott and Pete Farndon, without whom we would not have been here,"" she said, referring to the premature deaths of two of the band\'s guitarists from drug overdoses.\n\nBritain\'s Rod Stewart introduced Percy Sledge, citing his best-known hit When a Man loves a Woman as ""one of the best performances I\'ve ever heard"". Justin Timberlake introduced soul group the O\'Jays, a gospel-style quartet from Ohio, who performed a medley of their best-known songs including Back Stabbers, Love Train and For the Love of Money. ""Anyone who\'s ever written, produced or performed something soulful stands in the shadows of these giants,"" said Timberlake.\n\nJoining the ceremony at New York\'s Waldorf Astoria were legendary R&B star Bo Diddley, who performed with Eric Clapton and Robbie Robertson.\n\nClapton, alongside BB King, also introduced fellow guitarist Buddy Guy and recalled seeing him play as a teenager in England.

Santa Monica-based Activison is said to be one firm on its takeover list. Video games are ""big business"", the paper quoted Mr Chernin as saying. We ""would like to get into it"".\n\nThe success of products such as Sony\'s Playstation, Microsoft\'s X-Box and Nintendo\'s Game Cube have boosted demand for video games.\n\nThe days of arcade classics such as Space Invaders, Pac-Man and Donkey Kong are long gone. Today, games often have budgets big enough for feature films and look to give gamers as real an experience as possible. And with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies, video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun. Mr Chernin, however, told the FT that News Corp was finding it difficult to identify a suitable target. ""We are struggling with the gap between companies like Electronic Arts, which comes with a high price tag, and the next tier of companies,"" he explained during a conference in Phoenix, Arizona.

7,"b'Lewsey puzzle over disallowed try\n\nEngland\'s Josh Lewsey has claimed he was denied a late try in his side\'s Six Nations loss to Ireland.\n\nThe Wasps wing insisted he grounded the ball when he was bundled over the line and said referee Jonathan Kaplan had made a wrong decision. ""I\'m positive I touched the ball down over the line,"" Lewsey told BBC Sport. ""It certainly wasn\'t a turnover. ""I was driven over and I put the ball on the ground. The whistle went and I let go of the ball."" Lewsey added: ""One of the Irish players scooped it back after the whistle and to our surprise the referee then gave a turnover. ""As far as I\'m concerned, that incident and Mark Cueto\'s effort from Charlie Hodgson\'s cross-field kick that led to what looked like a good try were the two key elements in the game.""\n\nCueto was also puzzled as to why his try had been disallowed by Kaplan. ""I don\'t think I could have been offside for, without a doubt, I was behind the ball,"" said the Sale player. ""The move was a planned technique, it was not off the cuff. We rehearse it time and time again. ""I wouldn\'t say we were robbed, some decisions go with you and some go against you.

8,"b'Giggs handed Wales leading role\n\nRyan Giggs will captain Wales as he wins his 50th cap in Wednesday\'s friendly against Hungary in Cardiff.\n\nJohn Toshack, in his first game as coach after succeeding Mark Hughes, admits he is surprised that Giggs has only just reached the landmark. ""With the games he\'s played for United, proportionately it doesn\'t seem that many for Wales,"" Toshack said. ""But he\'s one of the greatest of all Welsh internationals and on his 50th cap it\'s appropriate he\'s captain."" Giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game, but is now targetting playing for Wales in the 2008 European Championships. The Manchester United wing revealed how club manager Sir Alex Ferguson talked him into extending his Wales career. ""I briefly discussed my international future with Sir Alex, but he urged me to carry on,"" Giggs said. ""He feels, like myself, that I have no weight problems and keep myself fit, so in three or four years\' time I will be able to play in the European finals if we get there. ""The manager has always wanted me to play for my club and country and he was keen for me to continue because I am fit enough.""\n\nGiggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former Wales skipper Gary Speed and United team-mate Paul Scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football. But Giggs is now focussed on making the Toshack era even more successful than the time Hughes spent at the helm. The Manchester United winger won his first cap as a 17-year-old in 1991, an away loss to Germany, and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31. With Giggs leading Wales out against Hungary, there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to Speed. However, Toshack refused to reveal whether he sees Giggs as a long-term option. ""For this particular game I think it is appropriate that Ryan Giggs will be captain, it\'s his 50th cap and he\'s known for some time about that,"" Toshack said. On Wednesday night Toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing Hughes, and Giggs said: ""It\'s my 50th cap and I am looking forward to it, and I hope to play a lot more times from here on in. ""It\'s important to be here, all the players feel the same. It\'s a new start and all the top players certainly see it as important. ""I see myself leading by example, it is something I have taken on for Wales as well as United these past few seasons. ""The way John is looking at things, he is aiming to build his side around the experienced lads right up to the next tournament, the Euro 2006 event. ""I have told John I will be around for the next European tournament, by then I will be 35 so hopefully I will still be okay. ""A lot can happen, but I\'m hoping to be around."" Giggs\' own personal future at Old Trafford is still up in the air as he has yet to reach agreement on a new contract, with Manchester United offering one extra year and Giggs seeking two. ""I have put the contract thing to the back of my mind at the moment,"" said Giggs. ""It is an important period for the club and I am just concentrated on that. ""I\'ve heard the suggestions, hopefully there is a two-year deal about to be offered because that is what I am looking for, to get it sorted out. ""I\'m enjoying my football, the way United have been playing and my own form, you have to enjoy it. ""We have massive games coming up: Manchester City this week, then the Everton cup tie, followed by AC Milan in the Champions League, and my first Wales game under John Toshack, so it\'s an important time.""\n'",sport,sport

And at 1815 GMT, Great Britain\'s rugby league team take on Australia in the final of the Tri-Nations tournament. ""Beating the Aussies in both games would be a massive achievement, especially for league,"" said Robinson. England have the chance to seal their third autumn international victory after successive wins over Canada and South Africa, as well as gaining revenge for June\'s 51-15 hammering by the Wallabies. Meanwhile, Great Britain could end 34 years of failure against Australia with victory at Elland Road. Britain have won individual Test matches, but have failed to secure any silverware or win the Ashes (with a series victory) since 1970.\n\n""They have a great opportunity to land a trophy and it would be a massive boost for rugby league in this country if we won,"" said Robinson.

The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China. The deal sees Rosneft receive $6bn in credits from China\'s CNPC.\n\nAccording to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, these credits would be used to pay off the loans Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk. Reports said CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. Analysts said one factor that might have influenced the Chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from Yukos, Yugansk\'s former owner, if CNPC had become a shareholder. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. ""The two companies [Rosneft and CNPC] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,"" said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan. ""There is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.""\n\nThe announcements help to explain how Rosneft, a medium-sized, indebted, and relatively unknown firm, was able to finance its surprise purchase of Yugansk. Yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.\n\nThe embattled Russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. But Yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once the country\'s richest man, Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.\n\nThe deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China\'s desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. China\'s thirst for products such as crude oil, copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels.

18,"b'Zambia confident and cautious\n\nZambia\'s technical director, Kalusha Bwalya is confident and cautious ahead of the Cosafa Cup final against Angola on Saturday in Lusaka.\n\nBwalya said: ""Nothing short of victory will do."" However Bwalya warned his side not to be too complacent. ""I don\'t want my team to be too comfortable or too sure of victory as it is going to be a difficult game. ""For me the main aim of the game is to enjoy and to win."" Zambia have shown their determination to win this final by recalling nine of their foreign-based players. However the 41 year-old Bwalya, who became the oldest player to appear in the competition when he played and scored against Mauritius, is uncertain whether he will take to the field or not. The Chipolopolo fans however are not being so cautious with a \'victory\' concert already scheduled for after the match featuring some of the country\'s top musicians. Both sides are hoping to win the competition for a record third time, and so keep the trophy for good. The Chipolopolo won the first two editions of the regional tournament for Southern African nations in 1997 and 1998. They were prevented from a third straight win by Angola who knocked out the Zambians at the semi-final stage in 1999. That victory for Angola also marked a first defeat in 14 years for Zambia at Lusaka\'s Independence stadium, where Saturday\'s game is being played. Angola named just four overseas-based players in their preliminary squad. The Palancas Negras have been unable to secure the release of many of their Portugal-based players.\n'",sport,sport
19,"b""Reliance unit loses Anil Ambani\n\nAnil Ambani, the younger of the two brothers in charge of India's largest private company, has resigned from running its petrochemicals subsidiary.\n\nThe move is likely to be seen as the latest twist in a feud between Mr Ambani and his brother Mukesh. Anil, 45, has stepped down as director and vice-chairman of Indian Petrochemicals Corporation (IPC). The company was not available for comment. IPC is 46%-owned by Reliance Industries which in turn is run by Mukesh. Mukesh has spoken of ownership issues between the two brothers, who took over control of the Reliance empire following the death of their father in July, 2002.\n\nReliance's operations have massive reach, covering textiles, telecommunications, petrochemicals, petroleum refining and marketing, as well as oil and gas exploration, insurance and financial services. The brothers' spat has hogged headlines in India during recent weeks, despite a denial from the family that there was anything wrong. Speculation has been rife about what has triggered the stand-off, with some observers blaming Anil's political ambitions, others the heavy investment by Mukesh and Reliance in a mobile phone venture. Shares of IPC dipped on the news in Mumbai, but recovered to trade almost 6% higher. Reliance shares added 1.7%, while Reliance Energy, headed by Anil, jumped 7%.\n""",business,business

""I thought I should explain myself before I disappear,"" said Michael, who was at the Berlin film festival to launch the documentary. The film, A Different Story, chronicles Michael\'s life and career from the 1980s and his personal struggles. The 41-year-old chart-topper told reporters in the German capital that he wanted to ""move his career into a different form"", but added that he does not know what it is going to be yet.\n\n""I\'m still going to be making music,"" he said, but added that he was ""not going to be around"". He hinted at discontent with the current state of music industry, and said: ""I don\'t really think that there is anyone in the modern pop business who I feel I want to spar with."" Michael said that the film, directed by Southan Morris, would put his two decades of fame into context. ""It\'s almost as much for me as for my fans, in terms of trying to make sense of the last 22 years and bring it to a close in a proper way,"" he said. The documentary chronicles the highs and lows of his life in the public gaze, from his meteoric rise as one half of pop duo Wham! to his arrest for lewd conduct in a Los Angeles toilet in 1998. The film also deals with the loss of Michael\'s partner Anselmo Feleppa from an Aids-related condition in 1993.

21,"b""How to make a greener computer\n\nThe hi-tech industry is starting to get more environmentally aware. Bill Thompson thinks it's about time.\n\nMy first car ran on four star petrol and pumped vast quantities of lead into the atmosphere as I drove around Cambridge. Now you can't buy petrol with lead additives, and we're all better off as a result. Chip giant Intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too, reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways.\n\nApart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic, mercury, cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves, the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up, with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents. And work is going into making power supplies that are more energy efficient, since current transformers are astonishingly wasteful as they charge our laptops, mobiles and music players.\n\nOne of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle. If you have got a phone or a computer with toxic chemicals or heavy metals in it then extracting them can be tricky and expensive. A well-designed electronic component is able to be recycled at low cost. This is going to be very important to hardware manufacturers in Europe since from August the new Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment directive will oblige them to accept returned products for recycling.\n\nThey will end up paying if they build things that are expensive or impossible to take apart and will find their profits hit, something which is likely to motivate them where appeals to the wider public interest might fall on deaf ears. It is, as they say, about time. We have a long and depressing history of developing new technologies with complete disregard for their potential impact on the environment, and waiting until there is a crisis looming before we try to redesign them to cause less damage. The car engine is a case in point: lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder, a phenomenon called 'knocking', so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere. Redesigning engines and making petrol slightly different was a lot more work, so it took decades before it was done. We're seeing the same thing in the technology industry and, as a result, there are billions of devices, from old mobile phones to antique handhelds, that will have to be recycled in years to come. If Apple gets its way then a lot of people are going to be buying a new Mac Mini and throwing away their old PC, keeping the monitor and other peripherals.\n\nEven if Apple does not get its way, four or five-year-old computers are not good enough to run modern programs and it's not unreasonable to replace them. But what do we do with the old ones?\n\nI've just looked around my office and I find two monitors, an old 386 PC, two old handhelds, three ancient laptops, four antique mobile phones, a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a Sun workstation that is no longer really much use. They are all old enough to be hazardous waste - the monitors alone will be full of arsenic and lead - but it's possible that some of the components could be useful. I could take them up the to the council recycling centre, but it's a 10-mile drive away across town, and like many other people my commitment to recycling is shallow at best. Here in Cambridge we have green bins for compostable waste, a box for glass, cans and paper that can be recycled, and a black bin for the rest. There are bottle banks and clothing banks scattered around town and in supermarket car parks. Would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too? I'd probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in a box - at least eventually.\n\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.\n""",tech,tech
22,"b'Millions to miss out on the net\n\nBy 2025, 40% of the UK\'s population will still be without internet access at home, says a study.\n\nAround 23 million Britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information, predicts the report by telecoms giant BT. It compares to 27 million, or 50%, of the UK, who are not currently online. The idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is ""wishful thinking"", the report concludes.\n\nThe study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. Although the percentage of Britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests. As more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts.\n\nThe gap between ""have-nets"" and ""have-nots"" has been much talked about, but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. BT set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. Optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests. ""Internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,"" said Adrian Hosford, director of corporate responsibility at BT. Costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. ""There is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. They don\'t have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits,"" said Mr Hosford.\n\nAs now, the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families, the older generation and the disabled.\n\nThose on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts. Organisations such as BT have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said Mr Hosford. The telco has seen positive results with its Everybody Online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around Britain. In one area of Cornwall with high levels of unemployment, online training helped people rewrite CVs and learn skills to get new jobs, explained Mr Hosford. Such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said. ""If we don\'t address this problem now, it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs, education opportunities will be limited and they\'ll simply not be able to keep up with society,"" he said. The Alliance for Digital Inclusion, an independent body with members drawn from government, industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.\n'",tech,tech

The concert was also part of an attempt to bring a broader range of events to the famous venue. Money raised will go to the Fondation pour l\'Enfance (Foundation for Childhood) which aims to rebuild a children\'s shelter in Sri Lanka. Sir Elton played hits from his vast back catalogue to a sell-out crowd which included former French president Valery Giscard d\'Estaing and his wife Anne-Aymone. The veteran pop star played piano accompaniment throughout the concert which lasted for three hours without an interval.\n\nHe told the crowd: ""Throughout the years, I\'ve done a lot of drugs and alcohol. It\'s true that I was a nightmare, impossible. For the last 14 years I\'ve been normal. Now my drug is called David"" - a reference to David Furnish, his partner. The crowd, who greeted each song with a standing ovation, also included French singer Charles Aznavour and British ambassador Sir John Holmes.

The 71-year-old served in Northern Ireland from 1981 to 1987 during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher. As a Northern Ireland minister he dealt with education and later security where he rode out the mass IRA escape from the Maze in 1983.\n\nIn education, he encountered criticism over school closures and the future of the Catholic training colleges. He also merged the New University of Ulster and the Ulster Polytechnic to create the University of Ulster. Sir Nicholas was a strong defender of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and was held in esteem in Dublin government and SDLP circles. But he experienced hostility from unionists some of whom dubbed him ""Minister of Discord"". After leaving Northern Ireland in a reshuffle, he became a UK disability minister. Sir Nicholas was replaced as the member for Kensington and Chelsea by the flamboyant Alan Clark, after being deselected by his constituency in December 1996. His deselection followed a series of scandals including being found slumped in the street by police during the Tory Party conference in Bournemouth and taken back to his hotel.\n\nSir Nicholas claimed strong painkillers he was taking for a back problem had reacted badly with a small amount of alcohol. After his sacking, he bitterly said that despite the support of Cabinet ministers and Tory backbenchers, the Eurosceptics in his constituency were ""absolutely determined to get rid of me"". His colourful career also included a very public disagreement with daughter Victoria over civil rights for the disabled. Sir Nicholas admitted he misled MPs when he denied his department had been involved in wrecking tactics designed to kill the Disability Bill in 1994. Victoria, a lobbyist for disabled rights, denounced her father\'s actions and heaped insult on injury when she joined the calls for him to resign. He joined the backbenches two months later.\n'",politics,politics

A 19-year-old man from Camberley, Surrey, was arrested by the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit but has been bailed. Operation Firewall, led by the US Secret Service, involved seven nations. The British teenager was arrested on Wednesday but details only emerged on Friday. He has now been bailed to return to a Surrey police station in December. All 28 people detained globally are suspected of being involved in an internet-based network which stole people\'s identities and used computers and websites to defraud credit card companies. The authorities in the US, who have indicted 19 people in Newark, New Jersey, estimate the fraud caused losses of more than $4m. Assistant US Attorney Scott Christie said several people had been arrested in Argentina, Bulgaria, Canada, Estonia, Poland and Sweden. Mr Christie said one of the ringleaders was believed to be a Russian, Anatoly Tyukanov.\n\nInvestigators from 30 law enforcement agencies worldwide spent 15 months looking into the activities of three websites - Shadowcrew, Carderplanet and Darkprofits. The US Secret Service was first tipped off in July 2003. An NHTCU spokeswoman said the American investigators went undercover on the Shadowcrew website and discovered some of the site\'s 4,000 members were using it for organised crime purposes.\n\nShe said criminals were using the websites to traffic counterfeit credit cards and false identification information and documents such as credit cards, driver\'s licences, passports and birth certificates. The websites shared tips on how to commit fraud and provided a forum by which people could buy the information and tools they needed to commit such crime, she said. The Shadowcrew site, which has now been taken over by the US Secret Service, listed several discussion groups, in English and Russian, including one on hacking, spam and online anonymity tools. The head of the NHTCU, Acting Detective Chief Superintendent, Mick Deats, said: ""This investigation has resulted in the significant disruption of organised criminals using the internet for profit.\n\n""We believe that the suspects have trafficked at least 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers, leading to losses by financial institutions running into the millions."" Chief Supt Deats went on to warn: ""The internet offers huge legitimate benefits for modern society; however with it brings powerful opportunities for those seeking to abuse those benefits for criminal gain. ""Your identity is one of the most precious commodities. Criminals who try to steal the personal and financial information of ordinary citizens as well as the confidential and proprietary information of companies engaged in e-commerce, will be targeted by law enforcement.""\n'",tech,business
26,"b'Mobiles rack up 20 years of use\n\nMobile phones in the UK are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend.\n\nBritain\'s first mobile phone call was made across the Vodafone network on 1 January 1985 by veteran comedian Ernie Wise. In the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of Britons own a handset. Mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline.\n\nThe first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in New York but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. The UK was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked. The first call was made from St Katherine\'s dock to Vodafone\'s head office in Newbury which at the time was over a curry house. For the first nine days of 1985 Vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the UK. Then on 10 January Cellnet (now O2) launched its service. Mike Caudwell, spokesman for Vodafone, said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase, cost about \xc2\xa32,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes.\n\n""Despite that they were hugely popular in the mid-80s,"" he said. ""They became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk."" This was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on. He said it took Vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million. ""It\'s very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people,"" he said. ""Cellnet was forecasting half that."" Now Vodafone has 14m customers in the UK alone. Cellnet and Vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the UK until 1993 when One2One (now T-Mobile) was launched. Orange had its UK launch in 1994. Both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology. The analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired. Called Global System for Mobiles (GSM) this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls. Mr Caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things, such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular.\n'",tech,tech

He said Brown was arrested at his hotel after the show at the Great American Music Hall but released without charge. San Francisco police said they could find no record of his arrest. Mr Smernicki said he had been told a fan ""rugby-tackled"" the singer during the gig, which resulted in ""pushing and shoving"".\n\nBrown then got into a brawl with another man who tried to restrain him - without realising he was a security guard, Mr Smernicki added. The star went off for 15 minutes before returning to finish his set. Police took witness statements and apprehended Brown at his hotel, Mr Smernicki said. But he was released without charge and ""as far as we\'re aware, that\'s the end of it"", Mr Smernicki added. A spokesperson for the San Francisco Police Department said he may have been detained but they could find no record of the incident. Brown, 42, was lead singer with The Stone Roses, one of the most seminal bands in British rock, until they split in 1996. He has since forged a successful solo career, scoring nine UK top 30 singles since 1998. In 1998, he was sentenced to four months in jail for using threatening behaviour towards an aeroplane captain and stewardess.\n'",entertainment,entertainment

It was blocked by Courtney Love, the widow of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, who did not want unreleased song You Know You\'re Right on the box set. The dispute between Love and surviving band members Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl was settled in 2002. Work began on the box set in 1998, but legal battles put the project on hold.

The set, released on Tuesday, features three CDs and a DVD of rare performance and rehearsal footage. The DVD also includes the first performance of Smells Like Teen Spirit, the track that launched Nirvana on to the international stage in 1991. ""The band wasn\'t always pretty, or always in tune.

The huge image of Delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the Dutch city taken at a fixed spot. If printed out in standard 300 dots per inch resolution, the picture would be 2.5m high and 6m long.\n\nThe researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures. Tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail. The website is already proving popular and currently has more than 200,000 visitors every day.\n\nThe image was created by imaging experts from the Dutch research and technology laboratory TNO which created the 2.5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge.\n\nThe goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images. The first image of such a size was manually constructed by US photographer Max Lyons in November 2003. That image portrayed Bryce Canyon National Park, in Utah, and was made up of 196 separate photographs. The panorama of Delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in Mr Lyons\' image. ""He did it all by hand, which was an enormous effort, and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques, it would be feasible to build a larger image,"" said Jurgen den Hartog, one of the TNO researchers behind the project. ""We were not competing with Mr Lyons, but it started as a lunchtime bet.""\n\nThe Dutch team used already available technologies, although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high-resolution image.\n\n""We had to rewrite almost all the tools,"" Me den Hartog told the BBC News website. ""All standard Windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image, so we had to develop one ourselves."" The 600 component pictures were taken on July 2004 by a computer-controlled camera with a 400 mm lens. Each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite. The stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful PCs over three days. Following the success of this project, and with promises of help from others, the TNO team is considering creating a full 360-degree panoramic view of another Dutch city, with even higher resolution.\n'",tech,tech

Santander\'s board of governors strongly reject the charges against their chairman, saying the payouts were legal and made with their unanimous support. But if convicted, Mr Botin could face a prison term of up to six years. Mr Corcostegui, a former CEO at Santander, also asked the court for new evidence to be admitted. In spite of the allegations against him, Mr Botin continues to lead Santander, and was instrumental in the \xc2\xa38.5bn takeover last November of the British bank Abbey National.

The Lib Dems say Labour is telephoning people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing calls. Labour denies breaking rules. It says calls are not marketing if they just ask about people\'s voting intentions. The party says it would expect the watchdog to take complaints seriously but it has clear legal advice on the issue.\n\nTelephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election. But seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has written to the watchdog accusing Labour of a ""flagrant and systematic breach"" of the laws governing the TPS.\n\nHe says the initial call may not be marketing but it identifies voters to whom the party can send promotional material in the future. His letter to the commissioner quotes from a Labour Party handbook about ""identifying target voters"". And it quotes a Stevenage Labour Party members\' newsletter explaining how voters will be telephoned about their voting intentions.\n\nThe voters are put in 24 categories according to their last known voting intention, ranging from ""Labour (firm)"" to ""target (Conservative)"" - those who supported the party in the past but this time will be voting Tory. The newsletter says: ""Using the information we know about people, we can send them direct mailings. ""For example, we could send the target (Conservative) people a letter from someone who had defected from the Tories to Labour explaining the reasons why voting Tory is a bad idea or we could send Labour (weak) people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote.""\n\nMr Taylor tells the commissioner: ""It is clear beyond peradventure from the above that the Labour Party is engaging in a large-scale voter ID project for subsequent promotional purposes through targeted and segmented mailings. ""Insofar as this project is directed at TPS subscribers, it is equally clear that it is unlawful."" The Lib Dems raised worries about Labour and Conservative calls in February and 680 people have signed up to the website they set up to help people to complain. A party official said there was only scattered evidence of the Tories breaking the rules but people had complained every day about Labour.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner\'s Office said it was examining one complaint about political calls - understood to be Mr Taylor\'s. ""We are investigating one of the complaints where some evidence has been given to us,"" she said. ""Obviously evidence is needed for us to start investigations."" The commissioner\'s office will now examine the Lib Dem evidence. ""The guidance is that cold calling can be made as long as no marketing is going on,"" said the spokeswoman. If Labour is judged to have broken the rules, it will be asked stop immediately. If it fails to do so after two or three warning letters, the commissioner can issue an enforcement notice spelling out what the party needs to do or stop doing.\n\nThe party could appeal against the decision to an Information Tribunal. If the appeal fails and it continues breaking the rules, it could be fined up to \xc2\xa35,000. Labour says it avoids those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but not when making ""voter identification"" calls. Asked about the commissioner\'s inquiry, a Labour spokesman told BBC News: ""We expect the information commissioner to take any complaint seriously. However, we are absolutely clear that we haven\'t broken any rules. ""As the information commissioner himself has said, if people are not marketing something, if they are asking them which way they are going to vote, they are not in breach of the law. ""We always ask everyone we phone up whether they would be happy to be contacted by the Labour Party again.""\n'",politics,politics
35,"b'Three DJs replace Peel radio show\n\nThe late John Peel\'s BBC Radio 1 show is to be succeeded in February by three shows hosted by three DJs focusing on diverse, non-commercial music.\n\nHuw Stephens, Ras Kwame and Rob Da Bank will each host the mid-week, late-night timeslot, showcasing UK talent. Radio 1 said the show would not try to replace Peel, but would rise to the ""challenge"" of ""keeping his legacy alive"" with unpredictable music. Peel died after suffering a heart attack in Peru in October. Radio 1 said the three DJs had been chosen for their ""in-depth musical knowledge across a variety of musical genres"". Rob Da Bank has been hosting The John Peel Show since the DJ\'s death. He is also one of the hosts of The Blue Room, an early morning weekend show that plays a mix of old and new electronic and dance music. Huw Stephens is currently one half of the Radio 1 Thursday night show Bethan and Huw in Wales, which explores new music, especially up and coming acts breaking through in Wales. And Ras Kwame is the host of 100% Homegrown on Radio 1\'s digital station 1Xtra. His show is dedicated to showcasing the best of UK black music and broadcasts live sessions, often giving new artists their first chance to perform on live national radio.\n\nAll of the three DJs will continue to host their current shows on Radio 1. ""It is widely accepted that John Peel can never be replaced,"" said the radio station. It added that One Music would support both signed and unsigned talent, and said: ""It will seek out those making music for music\'s sake rather than for commercial success. ""Above all it will provide support to emerging genres of music and styles that have not yet and may never reach the mainstream.""\n\nOne Music is not new to Radio 1 as it already exists as a website, offering advice on aspects of the music industry, such as recording a demo and signing a record contract. Radio 1\'s controller, Andy Parfitt, said: ""We believe that by having a series of DJs hosting a selection of shows under the One Music title, we will ensure that his legacy lives on."" Stephens said he grew up ""listening to John"" and that it was a ""massive honour"" to continue Peel\'s work championing new music. The show will be broadcast from 1 February on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2300 GMT - 0100 GMT.\n'",entertainment,entertainment

Some 63% of respondents in the Sunday Times poll thought his former lover - Kimberly Quinn - acted vindictively and 61% that he had been right to resign. YouGov polled a weighted sample of 1,981 voters online on 16-18 December. Mr Blunkett resigned as Home Secretary on Wednesday after an inquiry uncovered an e-mail showing a visa application by Mrs Quinn's former nanny had been speeded up. Sir Alan Budd's inquiry also found Mr Blunkett's account of events had been wrong. Almost a quarter (21%) of those polled for the Sunday Times said he should return to the Cabinet straight after the election. One in four said he should be back in the Government's top ranks within a year or two while 39% opposed a comeback.\n\nThree-quarters said Mr Blunkett was right to go to court for the right to see Mrs Quinn's son - whom he says he fathered - and just 14% voiced sympathy for Mrs Quinn. A total of 53% of those polled said they had sympathy for Mr Blunkett, with 40% saying they did not. Forty-three per cent thought Mr Blunkett had done a good job as home secretary and 17% disagreed. Meantime, 32% said Mr Blair was a good prime minister and 38% disagreed. A majority, 52%, said Chancellor Gordon Brown had done a good job and just 16% disagreed.\n\nA second poll for the Independent on Sunday found that support for all political parties remained largely unchanged after the Blunkett controversy. Labour lead the Conservatives by 39% to 34% with the Liberal Democrats on 19%. CommunicateResearch interviewed 401 people before David Blunkett's resignation and 601 afterwards. Some 82% said Mr Blunkett had set a good example by wanting to take responsibility for the child he says is his, but 42% backed his legal action compared to 45% who thought it was unbecoming. Thirty per cent said the affair showed Mr Blunkett could not be trusted as a minister while 63%, disagreed.\n""",politics,politics

Local favourite Lleyton Hewitt will meet France\'s Arnaud Clement, while defending champion and world number one Roger Federer faces Fabrice Santoro. Women\'s top seed Lindsay Davenport drew Spanish veteran Conchita Martinez.\n\nHenman came from two sets down to defeat Saulnier in the first round of the French Open last year, so he knows he faces a tough test in Melbourne. The seventh seed, who has never gone beyond the quarter-finals in the year\'s first major and is lined up to meet Roddick in the last eight, is looking forward to the match. ""He\'s tough player on any surface, he\'s got a lot of ability,"" he said. ""We had a really tight one in Paris that went my way so I\'m going to need to play well from the outset because he\'s a dangerous competitor."" Switzerland\'s Federer, seeded one, is the hot favourite having won three of the four grand slam titles in 2004. He has beaten Santoro in five of their seven previous encounters, but is taking nothing for granted. ""It\'s a tricky match,"" Federer said. ""I played him at the US Open and won quite comfortably then. But you never know, if the rhythm is a bit off, he can keep you guessing and make it difficult. ""The most important thing, though, is to get used to playing five-set matches and winning them."" The 23-year-old could meet four-time champion Andre Agassi in the quarter-finals before meeting Russian Marat Safin, the player he beat in last year\'s final.\n\nEighth-seeded American Agassi is set to play a qualifier in round one if he can shake off a hip injury which ruled him out of the Kooyong Classic. Second seed Andy Roddick will open his campaign against Irakli Labadze of Georgia. The American could meet Rusedski in the second round, seventh seed Henman in the quarter-finals and Hewitt in the last four. Hewitt is hoping to become the first Australian man to win the event since Mark Edmondson in 1976. The 23-year-old has never been beyond round four in eight attempts at Melbourne Park but has at least secured the opposite half of the draw to Federer, who beat him in the Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open last year. Safin, seeded four, opens his campaign against a qualifier with 16th seed Tommy Haas, the player he beat in the semi-finals in 2002, a possible fourth-round opponent.\n\nIn the women\'s draw, Davenport could encounter eighth-seeded Venus Williams in the quarter-finals and third-ranked Anastasia Myskina, the French Open champion, in the semi-finals. Bronchitis ruled Davenport, the 2000 Australian Open champion, out of her Sydney quarter-final on Thursday. Venus Williams, who lost to younger sister Serena in the Melbourne final two years ago, opens against Eleni Daniilidou of Greece. Serena Williams, who won her fourth consecutive grand slam at the 2003 Australian Open, was drawn in the bottom quarter with second seed Amelie Mauresmo, a runner-up in 1999. Serena will open against another Frenchwoman Camille Pin, while Mauresmo plays Australia\'s Samantha Stosur.

The Conservatives were in second place with donations totalling \xc2\xa34,610,849, while the Liberal Democrats received just over \xc2\xa31m. The majority of Labour's donations came from affiliated trade unions. There were also large sums from individuals. Lord Drayson, whose company PowderJect won multi-million pound contracts to provide smallpox vaccine to the government after the 11 September terror attacks, gave \xc2\xa3500,000 to the party just days before Christmas.\n\nThis followed an earlier donation of the same amount earlier in 2004. He was made a lord by Tony Blair last year. Other significant donations came from retired millionaire businessman and philanthropist Sir Christopher Ondaatje who gave the party a sum of \xc2\xa3500,000, and refrigerator magnate William Haughey OBE who gave \xc2\xa3330,000. The totals for the fourth quarter were well up on the same period of 2003, as the parties built up their war chests for the general election campaign. The largest donation to the Conservatives was a bequest from Ruth Beardmore of nearly \xc2\xa3400,000. The joint founder of merchant bank Hambro Magan gave \xc2\xa3325,417. There were also donations topping \xc2\xa3250,000 for the Conservatives from Scottish Business Groups Focus on Scotland and the Institute of International Research, the world's largest independent conference company.\n\nAlso among the gifts to the Tories were 24 donations totalling \xc2\xa3161,840 from Bearwood Corporate Services. This company is controlled by the party's former treasurer Lord Ashcroft which has directed almost \xc2\xa3300,000 to specific marginal constituencies over the past two years. The Liberal Democrats' largest donor was the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust Ltd, a company which promotes political reform and constitutional change, which gave a sum of \xc2\xa3250,000. And fast food giants McDonald's are listed as donating a sum of \xc2\xa310,575. This was a fee the firm paid for a room for an event held with the work and skills foundation during the party's conference. The UK Independence Party, which lost its main donor Paul Sykes amid the row over Robert Kilroy-Silk's bid for the leadership last autumn, took in \xc2\xa363,081. Just \xc2\xa38,170 of this was cash and the remainder came in gifts in kind, such as office space and printing. Registered political parties are required to set out each quarter all donations over \xc2\xa35,000 to their headquarters and over \xc2\xa31,000 to local constituency parties they receive. It is an offence for a person to knowingly or recklessly make a false declaration about party donations.\n""",politics,politics
39,"b""Reds sink 10-man Magpies\n\nTitus Bramble's own goal put Liverpool on the comeback trail as injury-hit Newcastle were well beaten at Anfield.\n\nPatrick Kluivert's close-range finish put Newcastle ahead after 31 minutes, but they were pegged back as Bramble headed in Steven Gerrard's corner. Neil Mellor gave Liverpool the lead before half-time from Milan Baros' pass before the Czech added a third after rounding Shay Given on the hour. Newcastle then had Lee Bowyer sent off for two bookable offences. Liverpool brought back Luis Garcia after a hamstring injury, while Newcastle were forced to draft in Kluivert after Craig Bellamy was a late withdrawal with a back injury sustained in the warm-up. And Garcia should have crowned his return with a goal inside the opening minute when he took a pass from Baros but shot wildly over the top from eight yards. Olivier Bernard was only inches away from giving Newcastle the lead after 20 minutes, when he fired just wide from a free-kick 25 yards out. But Souness's side did go ahead 11 minutes later in highly controversial circumstances.\n\nKluivert looked suspiciously offside when Kieron Dyer set Bowyer free, but the Dutchman was then perfectly placed to score from six yards. The lead lasted three minutes, with Liverpool back on terms as Bramble headed Gerrard's corner into his own net under pressure from Sami Hyypia. And Liverpool were ahead after 37 minutes when Baros slid a perfect pass into Mellor's path for the youngster to slip a slide-rule finish into Given's bottom corner. Garcia's finishing was wayward, and he was wasteful again in first-half injury time, shooting tamely at Given after good work by Xabi Alonso. Any hopes of a Newcastle recovery looked to be snuffed out on the hour when a brilliant turn and pass by Harry Kewell set Baros free and he rounded Given to score. Jermaine Jenas then missed a glorious chance to throw Newcastle a lifeline, shooting over from just eight yards out from Shola Ameobi's cross. Then Bowyer, who had already been booked for a foul on Alonso, was deservedly shown the red card by referee Graham Poll for a wild challenge on Liverpool substitute Florent Sinama-Pongolle.\n\nDudek, Finnan, Hyypia, Carragher, Riise, Luis Garcia (Nunez 73), Gerrard, Alonso, Kewell (Traore 85), Baros, Mellor (Sinama Pongolle 75).\n\nSubs not used: Hamann, Harrison.\n\nBramble 35 og, Mellor 38, Baros 61.\n\nGiven, Andrew O'Brien, Elliott, Bramble, Bernard, Bowyer, Dyer (Ambrose 80), Jenas, Milner (N'Zogbia 72), Kluivert (Robert 58), Ameobi.\n\nSubs not used: Harper.\n\nBowyer (77).\n\nBowyer, Elliott, Bernard.\n\nKluivert 32.\n\n43,856.\n\nG Poll (Hertfordshire).\n""",sport,sport

Analysts believe other sporting goods companies may now take a closer look at Rossignol, prompting an auction and pushing the sale price higher. Nike and K2 have previously been mentioned as possible suitors.\n\nRossignol shares touched 17.70 euros, before falling back to trade 7.8% higher at 16.60 euros. European sporting goods companies have seen foreign revenues squeezed by a slump in the value of the US dollar, making a takeover more attractive, analysts said. Companies such as Quiksilver would be able to cut costs by selling Rossignol skis through their shops, they added. The Boix-Vives family is thought to have spent the past couple of years sounding out possible suitors for Rossignol, which also makes golf equipment, snowboards and sports clothing.\n""",business,business

The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\n\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast. In the final quarter of 2004, businesses increased spending on capital equipment and software by 18%, up from 17.5% in the third quarter.

Instead of taxpayers having to pick up the bill, the FER wants Congressmen to change the PBGC\'s funding rules. The FER says firms should not have been allowed to reduce the insurance premiums they pay into the PBGC fund. The FER blames this on a 2004 law, in a statement signed by several members, who include Nobel economics laureate William Sharpe. It said it was ""dismayed"" at the situation and wants Congress to overturn the legislation.\n\nCash-strapped US companies, including those in the airline, car-making and steel industries, had argued in favour of the 2004 rule change, claiming that funding the insurance premiums adequately would force them to have to cut jobs. ""With a little firmer hand on the pensions issues in the US, I think that Congress could avoid having to turn to the taxpayer and instead turn the obligations back onto the companies that deserve to pay them,"" said Professor Dennis Logue, dean of Price College of Business at the University of Oklahoma. The PBGC was founded in 1974 to protect workers\' retirement rights. Its most recent action came last week when it took control of the pilots\' pension scheme at United Airlines.

Fiat and GM also ended their five-year alliance and two joint ventures in engines and purchasing, but did agree to continue buying each other\'s engines.\n\n""Powertrain told us today that Alfa Romeo engines will no longer be made in Arese,"" said union leader Vincenzo Lilliu, as reported by the Reuters news agency. ""The assembly line will be dismantled and the six-cylinder Alfa Romeo motor will be replaced with an engine GM produces in Australia."" Reuters also said that Mr Lilliu and other union bosses shouted insults at Fiat chairman Luca di Montezemolo, following a meeting on Tuesday regarding the future of the Arese plant. The unions said the end of engine production at the facility would mean the loss of 800 jobs. All Alfa Romeo models can be bought with a six-cylinder engine - the 147, 156, 156 Sportwagon, 166, GTV, GT and Spider.\n'",business,business
50,"b'New rules tackle \'sham weddings\'\n\nNew rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the UK are coming into force.\n\nFrom Tuesday, most non-EU citizens will need Home Office approval to marry. The Home Office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages, of which there are estimated to be up to 15,000 a year. But immigrants\' group the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) says the rules breach human rights law and it may mount a legal challenge. When the changes were unveiled last year, immigration minister Des Browne said: ""Our aim is to avoid unnecessary disruption of genuine marriages, while providing firm controls to prevent abuse."" Under the previous regulations anybody wishing to get married in the UK only had to produce evidence they had been resident in the country for a week and give 15 days notice of the wedding at the local register office.\n\nBut from Tuesday all non-EU nationals, apart from citizens of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland or Norway, intending to wed in the UK must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a Home Office \'certificate of marriage approval\'. To get a certificate, costing \xc2\xa3135, applicants will have to send proof that they have a legal right to be in the UK. Those without a settled status, such as asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application, will have no right to marry in the UK.\n\nOnce they have the necessary documentation, those subject to immigration controls wishing to get married in England or Wales must register their intention to marry at one of 76 specially-designated register offices. They can, however, marry at the register office or church of their choice. Rhian Beynon of the JCWI said the new rules were ""not proportionate"" and ""discriminatory"".\n\n""These rules means in some cases the Home Secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort. ""We\'re currently taking a legal opinion on this. We\'ll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we\'ll be looking at taking a case on this to the Human Rights Court,"" Ms Beynon said. The new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. In a report published last July the cross-party committee stated there was a ""significant risk"" the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were ""disproportionate"". The committee believed the new laws might be incompatible with the Human Rights Act on the grounds of religion, belief and nationality, the report added.\n\nOver the last year immigration service operations against marriages of convenience have been stepped up resulting in a growing number of convictions. In January 25 people who took part in a sham marriage network based in Leicester were jailed for a total of 35 years. And last November Samuel Amoah, a Belgian national who set up two sham weddings for couples who wanted to remain in the UK, was jailed for three years. Several other cases are currently going through the courts. The role of registrars who under the Asylum and Immigration Act 1999 were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the Home Office, has been key in many prosecutions. Registrars\' spokesman, Mark Rimmer, said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent. ""They will effectively remove most of the blatant cases. Certainly those who are illegals in this country, of which we had quite a few, will no longer be getting married,"" Mr Rimmer said. Mr Rimmer, the service director for registrations of marriages at Brent Council in north-west London, said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties. ""It may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it\'s still not as difficult to marry in the UK than it is to marry, for example, in Holland, Germany or France. ""I think it\'s a proportionate response by government to what was a very large problem,"" Mr Rimmer said.\n'",politics,politics
51,"b""Firefox browser takes on Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft's Internet Explorer has a serious rival in the long-awaited Firefox 1.0 web browser, which has just been released.\n\nFew people get excited when some new software is released, especially when the program is not a game or a music or movie player. But the release of the first full version of Firefox has managed to drum up a respectable amount of pre-launch fervour. Fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the New York Times announcing that version 1.0 of the browser is available. The release of Firefox 1.0 on 9 November might even cause a few heads to turn at Microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giant's Internet Explorer browser.\n\nFirefox has been created by the Mozilla Foundation which was started by former browser maker Netscape back in 1998. Much of the development work done since then has gone into Firefox which made its first appearance under this name in February. Earlier incarnations, but which had the same core technology, were called Phoenix and Firebird. Since then the software has been gaining praise and converts, not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Rivals to IE got a boost in late June when two US computer security organisations warned people to avoid the Microsoft program to avoid falling victim to a serious vulnerability.\n\nInternet monitoring firm WebSideStory has charted the growing population of people using the Firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of IE. Before July this year, according to WebSideStory, Internet Explorer was used by about 95% of web surfers. That figure had remained static for years. In July the IE using population dropped to 94.7% and by the end of October stood at 92.9%. The Mozilla Foundation claims that Firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10% of the Windows- using, net-browsing population. Firefox is proving popular because, at the moment, it has far fewer security holes than Internet Explorer and has some innovations lacking in Microsoft's program. For instance, Firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them. It blocks pop-ups, has a neat way of finding text on a page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed.\n\nOne of the most powerful features of Firefox is the many hundreds of extras, or extensions, produced for it. The Mozilla Foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program. This has resulted in many different add-ons or extensions for the browser which now include everything from a version of the familiar Google toolbar to a Homeland Security monitor that keep users aware of current threat levels. Firefox, which used to be called Firebird and before that Phoenix, also has a growing number of vocal net-based fans. A campaign co-ordinated by the Spread Firefox website attempted to raise the $50,000 needed for a full page advert in the New York Times. The campaign set itself a target of recruiting 2500 volunteers. Ten days in to the campaign 10,000 people had signed up and now about $250,000 has been raised. The ad is due to run sometime in a three-week period in late November/early December. The surplus cash will be used to help keep the Mozilla Foundation running. Microsoft is facing a growing challenge to IE's hold on the web using population. from alternative browsers such as Opera, Safari, Amaya and even Netscape.\n""",tech,tech
52,"b'SEC to rethink post-Enron rules\n\nThe US stock market watchdog\'s chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new US corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms.\n\nIn a speech at the London School of Economics, William Donaldson promised ""several initiatives"". European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly. The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nThe Act comes into force in mid-2005. It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.\n\nFirms that break the new law could face huge fines, while senior executives risk jail terms of up to 20 years. Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would ""continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements"". There are few, if any, who disagree with the intentions of the Act, which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts. But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing. The Act also applies to firms with more than 300 US shareholders, a situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in.\n\nThe 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy, a delisting. Mr Donaldson said the SEC would ""consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process"" for foreign firms unwilling to meet US requirements.\n\n""We should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections"" without turning the US market into ""one with no exit"", he said. He revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the Act\'s least popular measure - Section 404 - for foreign firms. Seen as particularly costly to implement, Section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm\'s internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including US ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (\xc2\xa3374m).\n\nA delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change, the Financial Times reported.\n\nIt was led by Digby Jones, director general of the UK\'s Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and included representatives of BASF, Siemens and Cadbury Schweppes. Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings. Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (\xc2\xa3558m) stock market debut last month. There are also rumours that two Chinese state-run banks - China Construction Bank and Bank of China - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New York later this year. Instead, the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in Hong Kong, according to press reports in China.\n'",business,business
53,"b'Hewitt overcomes wobble in Sydney\n\nLleyton Hewitt gave himself the perfect preparation for next week\'s Australian Open with victory over Ivo Minar in the final of the Sydney International.\n\nThe defending champion brushed aside the Czech qualifier 7-5 6-0. The Australian world number three strolled to the first five games of the match but was shocked as Minar won the next five. The top seed was rattled but recovered to close out the set and raced to victory in exactly an hour. ""It was a strange match . . . momentum swings,"" said Hewitt. ""I felt like I came out of the blocks extremely well, but then he loosened up a bit. ""When he got back to 5-5, I had to try to settle down and take it up a notch, and I was able to do that.""\n\nHewitt has now lifted the Sydney title four times in the last six years. ""It just keeps getting better and better every year,"" Hewitt said. ""I\'ve only played this tournament four times and I\'ve won it four times."" Hewitt went into the final as a short-priced favourite to clinch his 24th career title after dropping only one set all week. He is set to meet Frenchman Arnaud Clement in the first round of the Australian Open. Minar, ranked 158th in the world, was forced to pull out of the Australian Open qualifying draw to play in his first ATP final. ""For me, this was a big success,"" said the 20-year-old. ""I was so nervous last night I couldn\'t sleep. I\'ve never played a top-10 player before. ""I wanted to play qualifying in Melbourne, but it\'s Saturday and I\'m still here.

54,"b'Visa row mandarin made Sir John\n\nThe top civil servant at the centre of the David Blunkett visa affair has been knighted in the New Year Honours.\n\nSir John Gieve was Home Office permanent secretary during the saga which ended with Mr Blunkett quitting. He and other civil servants were criticised for failing to recall how the visa for Mr Blunkett\'s ex-lover\'s nanny came to be fast-tracked. The outgoing head of the troubled Child Support Agency Doug Smith also earns an honour in the New Year\'s list. Mr Smith, 57, whose retirement was announced by Work and Pensions Secretary Alan Smith in November, is made a Commander of the Order of Bath.\n\nBoth men were giving evidence to a Commons committee on the computer difficulties facing the agency, which left thousands of single parents without any maintenance payments, when the announcement was made. The knighting of Sir John, 54, will be received with astonishment by opposition politicians.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats said it ""beggared belief"" he and fellow officials could not remember how Leoncia Casalme\'s application for indefinite leave to remain went from Mr Blunkett\'s office to the head of the Immigration and Nationality Department. Meanwhile, the Conservatives accused officials of a ""collective failure"" of memory. But Sir Alan Budd, who led an inquiry into the affair, said he had no reason to believe anyone involved had deliberately withheld information.\n\nDowning Street defended the decision to honour both men, with a spokesperson saying: ""You have to look at their whole career."" Sir John was made permanent secretary in April 2001 following a Civil Service career which dates back to 1974. He has also worked in the Treasury and the Department of Employment. A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said of Mr Smith\'s honour: ""The award reflects all that he has achieved in a Civil Service career, principally in the Inland Revenue, spanning over 40 years - not just his role as chief executive of the Child Support Agency.\n\n""In his career he has personally led a number of successful major change programmes."" Mr Smith is set to stay on at the CSA until March. Less controversial will be the knighthoods for Derek Wanless and Mike Tomlinson, who undertook major government reviews on health and education respectively. Former NatWest chief executive Mr Wanless, 57, has delivered not one but two major reports on the NHS.

55,"b'Labour seeks to quell feud talk\n\nLabour\'s leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.\n\nMr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair. A private meeting on Monday saw normally loyal MPs warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.\n\nThe event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown\'s traditional poll planning role. But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. Asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister, Mr Brown replied: ""You can see that our record on the economy is about the British people trusting us to run the economy.""\n\nHe refused to comment on the new book, saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. Mr Brown later told reporters: ""Of course I trust the prime minister."" Downing Street cited that comment when reporters\' suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair: ""There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe"". Labour\'s new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. They urge voters not to let the Tories take things backwards. Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign ""which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country"".\n\nConservative co-chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call, saying: ""The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H."" Labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English-speaking world, he said.\n\nThe prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday\'s meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston\'s new book. Mr Blair told MPs and peers: ""I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need."" Labour\'s Paul Flynn said the pair had had a ""scorching"" from MPs.\n\nOn Tuesday, deputy prime minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: ""They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line."" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. ""Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,"" he joked.\n'",politics,politics
56,"b'Tories unveil quango blitz plans\n\nPlans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the Conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut.\n\nSix government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the Tories say would save more than \xc2\xa34.3bn. Among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities. Tory frontbencher John Redwood said Britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive.\n\nThe plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies, such as boards tackling industrial development and housing. Their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government. The Tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people, rather than officials, run hospitals and surgeries.\n\nAnnouncing the plans, Mr Redwood said: ""Mr Blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers, and has broken the pledges he made. ""Far from improving public services, spending taxpayers\' money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes."" His party leader, Michael Howard, argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending. ""Labour are creating Two Britains: the Britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic Britain,"" he said. ""In the real world, people are working harder just to stand still. They\'ve seen their pensions knocked for six. ""They\'re being squeezed by extra taxes. The forgotten majority are paying the price of bureaucratic Britain.""\n\nThe government has announced plans to cut 100,000 civil servants as part of its efficiency drive. But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Paul Boateng attacked the Tory plans. ""The Conservatives are committed to cutting Labour\'s public spending plans by a massive \xc2\xa335 billion,"" he said. ""Cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting \'bureaucracy\' but would require massive cuts to front-line public services such as schools, hospitals and the police.""

It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move.\n\nFor years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton. And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002.

""Obviously we have failed in that. I just hope Manchester can handle the crowds. ""It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn\'t want to come to the main working class resort in the country.""

58,"b'Wenger steps up row\n\nArsene Wenger has stepped up his feud with Sir Alex Ferguson by claiming the Manchester United manager is guilty of bringing football into disrepute.\n\nThe pair\'s long-running row was put back in the headlines on Saturday when Ferguson said his Arsenal counterpart was ""a disgrace"". Wenger initially refused to bite back, saying only: ""I will never answer any questions any more about this man."" But now he claims Ferguson should be punished by the Football Association. The latest twist in the Ferguson-Wenger saga came on Saturday when the United boss, in an interview with The Independent newspaper, discussed the events after the game between the two sides in October. United won 2-0 that day, at Old Trafford, but the game was followed by a now notorious food fight which saw Ferguson\'s clothes covered in soup and pizza. The sides meet again at Highbury on 1 February. ""In the tunnel Wenger was criticising my players, calling them cheats, so I told him to leave them alone and behave himself,"" Ferguson said on Saturday. ""He ran at me with hands raised saying \'what do you want to do about it?\' ""To not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager is unthinkable. It\'s a disgrace, but I don\'t expect Wenger to ever apologise, he\'s that type of person.""\n\nThose allegations were put to Wenger after Saturday\'s game at Bolton, which Arsenal lost to slip 10 points behind Chelsea in the title race. At first he said only: ""I\'ve always been consistent with that story and told you nothing happened. ""If he has to talk, he talks. If he wants to make a newspaper article, he makes a newspaper article. ""He doesn\'t interest me and doesn\'t matter to me at all. I will never answer to any provocation from him any more. ""He does what he likes in England anyway. He can go abroad one day and see how it is."" But later on Saturday, according to The Independent, Wenger spoke to a smaller group of reporters and expanded on his reaction. ""I have no diplomatic relations with him,"" the Arsenal boss is quoted as saying. ""What I don\'t understand is that he does what he wants and you (the press) are all at his feet.\n\n""The situation (concerning the food fight) has been judged and there is a game going on in a month. ""The managers have a responsibility to protect the game before the game. But in England you are only punished for what you say after the game. ""Now the whole story starts again. I don\'t go into that game. We play football. I am a football manager and I love football above all ... no matter what people say."" Reminded that Ferguson called him ""a disgrace"", Wenger added: ""I don\'t respond to anything. In England you have a good phrase. It is \'bringing the game into disrepute\'. ""But that is not only after a game, it is as well before a game.""\n\nFerguson had also claimed that United chief executive David Gill and Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein had agreed at boardroom level not to discuss the incident in public. But Ferguson added: ""In the ensuing weeks all you got was a diatribe from Arsenal about being kicked off the pitch and all that nonsense. Gill phoned Dein three times to complain but nothing was done. ""The return is on 1 February and they will come out with another diatribe. ""David Gill and I feel we should set the record straight because Arsenal have not written to us to apologise and we would not let that happen here."" Meanwhile, the League Managers Association have offered to act as peacemakers in the hope of resolving the on-going row. During that stormy game in October, United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy caught Arsenal\'s Ashley Cole with one particularly strong tackle. Wenger later accused Van Nistelrooy of ""cheating"" and was fined \xc2\xa315,000 and ""severely reprimanded"" by the Football Association. Ferguson admitted on Saturday that Van Nistelrooy\'s tackle, which earned the Dutchman a ban, ""could have given (Cole) a serious injury"", but he believes Arsenal were the main aggressors.\n\n""Wenger is always complaining the match was not played in the right spirit,"" he added. ""They are the worst losers of all time, they don\'t know how to lose. Maybe it is just Manchester United, they don\'t lose many games to other teams. ""We tend to forget the worst disciplinary record of all time was Arsenal\'s up until last season. In fairness it has improved and now they are seen as paragons of virtue. ""But to Wenger it never happens, it is all some dream or nightmare.""\n'",sport,sport

The quotas for developing nations, ended on 1 January, gave them a set share of the rich countries\' markets. They also limited the amount countries like China could export to the big markets of the United States and EU.\n\n""We understand that some (owners)... were complaining that the South African rand was strong against the US dollar, and they were losing when exporting textiles and clothing to the United States,"" Mr Macaefa said at a news briefing in the capital, Maseru. Lesotho\'s currency, the maloti, is fixed to the rand. ""But we suspect that they left the country unceremoniously because of the end of quotas introduced by the World Trade Organization."" He said the six factories were Leisure Garments, Modern Garments, Precious Six Garments, TW Garments, Lesotho Hats and Vogue Landmark. The owners - two from Taiwan, two from China, one from Mauritius and one from Malaysia - left over the December holiday period without informing or paying their employees, he said.\n\nUnion leaders and trade campaigners have been warning that developing nations such as Lesotho, Sri Lanka, and Bangaldesh could lose thousands of jobs once the quotas were lifted. In the mountainous country surrounded by South Africa, it is feared as many as 50,000 textile workers could lose their jobs, and Mr Mafeca said he expected more companies to leave. The assistance of a US law had given Lesotho\'s textiles duty-free access to North American markets. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), gave sub-Saharan countries preferential access to the US market for apparel and textile products as well as a wide range of other goods. A Lesotho government news briefing is expected on Wednesday.\n'",business,business
60,"b'Brown to outline presidency goals\n\nNext year will be ""make or break"" for development in poorer countries Gordon Brown will say as he sets out UK goals for its EU and G8 presidencies.\n\nThe chancellor is due to outline a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005. They will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations. Mr Brown also wants other G8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.\n\nHe also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for Aids and malaria. The chancellor is travelling to America next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue. He told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme: ""We need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health, of illiteracy, of poverty, particularly in Africa but right through the developing countries.""\n\nHis proposals were effectively a new ""Marshall Plan"" for the world, including an international finance facility, which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year. Agreement in the Doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability they needed, he argued. The European Union\'s Common Agricultural Policy had caused aggravated trade problems, he said, but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies.\n\nMr Brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years. But with 30,000 children were dying unnecessarily every day more was needed, including 100% debt relief multilaterally. ""That is why next year is a test,"" he said. ""If after five years of making promises the world is not prepared to honour them, then people will be justified in saying they promised but they did not produce results."" The Catholic aid agency Cafod will host Mr Brown\'s speech on Wednesday.\n\nCafod wants Britain to use its influence to pressure countries like the US to make firm commitments to tackle global poverty. Mr Brown said America too needed to take more action but defended President George Bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption. Oxfam\'s Paying the Price report this week said 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels. The charity\'s director, Barbara Stocking, said: ""2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough, but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure."" The report said the G8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid.\n\nBut 34 years later none of the organisations members had reached this target and many had not yet set a timetable. Mr Blair, who has described Africa as a ""scar"" on the world\'s conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his G8 priorities along with climate change and the Aids epidemic. But Band Aid founder Bob Geldof in July said he was sick of hearing ""guff"" about scars on the world. It was pathetic that Britain was the 4th richest country in the world but only the 11th most generous aid donor, he added. Conservative shadow international development secretary Alan Duncan accused Mr Brown of missing his target on providing anti-retroviral drug treatment to three million Africans by 2005. Instead, only 500,000 people would benefit, he said. ""There\'s no point in him demanding praise and adulation for setting a whole new raft of targets when he has so woefully failed to meet the ones he already has,"" added Mr Duncan.\n'",politics,politics

Shanda said that it may boost its stake in Sina, even buying it outright. A merger would create a firm that offers online role-playing games, news, entertainment and wireless messaging.\n\nSina said that the purchase of a stake by Shanda would have no impact on its business.\n\nThe board of directors said in a statement that it would ""continue to act in the best interests of all the company stakeholders, including shareholders, employees and customers"". Both companies are listed on the New York Stock Exchange\'s (NYSE) technology-dominated Nasdaq index. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Sina said its shares were purchased between 12 January and 10 February for about $230m. Rumours about a possible takeover boosted Sina\'s shares by more than 10% on Friday. They added an extra 6.4% to $27.24 in electronic trading after the trading session had finished. And there may be more gains amid bid speculation when trading resumes in New York on Tuesday after Monday\'s public holiday, analysts forecast. ""There could still be some potential parties that could still counter bid,"" said Wallace Cheung, an analyst at DBS Vickers. ""Even though Shanda has 20% of Sina, they still have quite a long way to take full control.""

Mr Sullivan ""made accounting decisions,"" he told the federal court, saying his finance chief had ""a keen command of the numbers"". Mr Ebbers has denied charges of fraud and conspiracy. During his second day of questioning in the New York trial Mr Ebbers played down his working relationship with Mr Sullivan and denied he frequently met him to discuss company business when questioned by the prosecution.\n\n""In a lot of weeks, we would speak ... three or four times,"" Mr Ebbers said, adding that conversations about finances were rarely one-on-one and were usually discussed by a ""group of people"" instead.\n\nMr Ebbers relationship to Mr Sullivan is key to the case surrounding financial corruption that led to the collapse of the firm in 2002 following the discovery of an $11bn accounting fraud. The prosecution\'s star witness is Mr Sullivan, one of six WorldCom executives indicted in the case, He has pleaded guilty to fraud and appeared as a prosecution witness as part of an agreement with prosecutors. During his time on the witness stand Mr Sullivan repeatedly told jurors he met frequently with Mr Ebbers, told him about changes made to WorldCom\'s accounts to hide costs and had warned him such practises were improper. However during the case on Tuesday Mr Ebbers denied the allegations. ""I wasn\'t advised by Scott Sullivan of anything ever being wrong,"" he told the court. ""He\'s never told me he made an entry that wasn\'t right. If he had, we wouldn\'t be here today."" Mr Ebbers could face a jail sentence of up to 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. Shareholders lost about $180bn in WorldCom\'s collapse, 20,000 workers lost their jobs and the company went bankrupt. The company emerged from bankruptcy last year and is now known as MCI.\n'",business,business
63,"b'Fannie Mae \'should restate books\'\n\nUS mortgage company Fannie Mae should restate its earnings, a move that is likely to put a billion-dollar dent in its accounts, watchdogs have said.\n\nThe Securities & Exchange Commission accused Fannie Mae of using techniques that ""did not comply in material respects"" with accounting standards. Fannie Mae last month warned that some records were incorrect. The other main US mortgage firm Freddie Mac restated earnings by $5bn (\xc2\xa32.6bn) last year after a probe of its books. The SEC\'s comments are likely to increase pressure on Congress to strengthen supervision of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nThe two firms are key parts of the US financial system and effectively underwrite the mortgage market, financing nearly half of all American house purchases and dealing actively in bonds and other financial instruments. The investigation of Freddie Mac in June 2003 sparked concerns about the wider health of the industry and raised questionsmarks over the role of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), the industry\'s main regulator. Having been pricked into action, the OFHEO turned its attention to Fannie May and in September this year said that the firm had tweaked its books to spread earnings more smoothly across quarters and play down the amount of risk it had taken on. The SEC found similar problems. The watchdog\'s chief accountant Donald Nicolaisen said that ""Fannie Mae\'s methodology of assessing, measuring and documenting hedge ineffectiveness was inadequate and was not supported"" by generally accepted accounting principles.\n'",business,business
64,"b'Media gadgets get moving\n\nPocket-sized devices that let people carry around video and images are set to have a big year in 2005, according to industry experts.\n\nLast year saw the emergence of portable media players, such as the Windows-based Creative Zen portable media player, the Samsung Yepp, the iRiver PMC-100, and the Archos AV400 series among others. But this year, they are set to get smarter and more connected, to allow people to find more video to watch on them. Archos launched its latest range of its Linux-based portable media devices at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Friday. Dubbed the Pocket Media Assistant PMA430, it crucially has wi-fi capability built-in for the first time. ""Consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access,"" said Henri Crohas, chief of Archos. ""And now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time."" Archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in people\'s pockets, after the mobile.\n\nUnlike Windows-based players, the Archos AV400 series devices have always been able to record from any video source, such as TVs, as well as playback. The content put onto the devices is copy protected so cannot then be swapped to another device.\n\nRecording is perhaps a crucial functionality for those who have not seen the point of portable video if there is not a lot of video to watch on it. And wi-fi connectivity opens up the possibility of content delivery via a high-speed wireless link. Archos also announced that it would open up the software development kit to Linux developers so that more applications could be created for the device. Microsoft also made some announcements in the portable media arena at CES, primarily for US consumers though. It has agreed a content deal with personal video recorder company TiVo, which Bill Gates also showcased in his keynote speech at CES. The TiVo To Go service means that US consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their TiVos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the Windows-based portable media players or smartphones. It also said it had launched a service with MTV to let people watch Comedy Central, VH1 and Country Music TV on its devices. And a service is launching with MSN to provide people with shortened versions of news, entertainment and other video on a subscription basis for download via the PC onto the portable devices. But the ability to record directly from TV, VCR, and digital cable and satellite boxes, which Windows-based devices do not offer, certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too.\n\nThe increased capability of these devices, and the content deals that are being done, may go some way to persuading people to use them. Recent research by Jupiter suggested that people would prefer a device that was dedicated to music. Only 13% of Europeans wanted to watch video while on the move. More seemed interested in spending their cash on music-only devices.\n\n""This year, we are ready for an explosion of portable media,"" Microsoft\'s Mike Coleman told the BBC News website. ""We are very bullish about it. The fact that I can put photos on here too and share them is super-cool to the consumer,"" he added. The fact that Europeans are far larger public transport users than Americans is one reason why portable media will take off in the coming year too. There is a burgeoning market there for commuters to watch news and other programmes on their way to work. Although Microsoft\'s content distribution deals are for the US market at the moment, talks were ""always on-going"" with European content suppliers to offer similar services. Various rights management issues have to be ironed out first however. But that does not prevent people from finding ways to create their own content to share online and swap on portable devices, particularly via those which are wi-fi enabled. The possibility is open for non-professional makers of video and audio to take advantage of the growing portable media market to distribute their work. CES, which runs from 6 to 9 January, showcases more than 50,000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005.\n'",tech,tech
65,"b'Plan to give elderly care control\n\nElderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans.\n\nMinisters say elderly and disabled people themselves, not social workers, should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes. They also plan a supremo for adult services in each English area to get different agencies working together. But the government shunned opponents\' calls for free long-term care.\n\nThere are 1.7m people needing care in England and ministers suggest the number could quadruple by 2050. Monday\'s consultation paper on social care for adults in England is aimed at ending a system which generates dependency. Health Minister Stephen Ladyman said: ""This document is the antithesis of the nanny state.\n\n""It\'s about taking power away from the state and giving it to individuals and saying that we will help you make these decisions but we are not going to make them for you any more."" The government has already allowed local councils to give people money so they can pay for their services directly but take-up of the scheme has been ""disappointing"".\n\nMinisters say the new plans would make direct payments simpler and try to counter reluctance in some local councils to use the payments. They also want to set up a new ""half-way house"" where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that ""individual budget"". The scheme will be funded on existing budgets set until 2008. But Mr Ladyman said the plans could deliver savings in some areas, such as freeing up NHS beds and preventing illnesses. He ruled out free personal care in England - which is on offer in Scotland and Wales, saying it was ""unsustainable"".\n\nDavid Rogers, from the Local Government Association, said agencies were working together on the kind of innovation proposed by the government. And Tony Hunter, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said the plans could improve dignity and well-being for thousands of people. But Age Concern argued social care was chronically under-funded and older people were being offered choice in principle, but not in practice. Its director general, Gordon Lishman, said: ""Direct payments will not work if there are no services for people to choose from locally.""\n\nThe Tories say people who pay for three years\' long-term care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives. Tory spokesman Simon Burns said more than 80,000 long term care places had been lost since 1997. ""After eight years of persistent change, dogmatic enforcement of regulation, and overbearing government initiatives - we need action, not a vision,"" said Mr Burns. The Lib Dems say they would fund free personal care by a new 50% tax rate on incomes over \xc2\xa3100,000. Health spokesman Paul Burstow said: ""Promoting independence sounds good and helping people to live in their own homes is a goal we share. ""But the risk is that independence can turn into isolation if the right support and care is not available.""\n'",politics,politics

But Deutsche Boerse told news agency Reuters such a move would have to wait until May\'s annual general meeting. Investors want Deutsche to return cash to shareholders rather than bid. ""We are long-term investors and are experienced in removing management. We are not scared to take this to its conclusion this time,"" Atticus\' David Slager told the Sunday Times. However, Deutsche Boerse told Reuters: ""TCI\'s request for the removal of the supervisory board will be considered at the annual general meeting on May 25.""\n\nThe Sunday Times reported that TCI had been drawing up a list of heavyweight executives to replace Deutsche\'s chairman Rolf Breuer and chief executive Werner Seifert. The group owns more than 5% of Deutsche - more than enough to demand an extraordinary general meeting to call on shareholders to oust the German exchange\'s management. Under German law Deutsche does not need investor backing to make a takeover bid. TCI and Atticus have opposed the LSE bid for some time saying it would destroy shareholder value, and would be better spent on a share buyback. Deutsche is in competition with pan-European bourse Euronext to take over the London exchange. Many commentators have suggested a bidding war between the two could break out. However, any such move would have to wait until March when the Office of Fair Trading completes an investigation into the competition aspects of the pair\'s takeover proposals.\n'",business,business
67,"b'Neeson in bid to revive theatre\n\nHollywood film star Liam Neeson has held a dinner party in New York to promote Belfast\'s Lyric Theatre.\n\nThe Ballymena-born actor said that the theatre on Ridgeway Street was in a ""very dilapidated condition"". Lyric chairman David Johnston has said that rebuilding the theatre, at a cost of \xc2\xa38m is the only answer. Mr Neeson said that the idea was to get a bunch of ""healthy, wealthy Irish Americans"" in one room and ask them to help with fundraising.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated actor, whose films include Schindler\'s List, Michael Collins and Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, said: ""The Lyric is too important to the cultural and social life of Northern Ireland for this building to crumble and fall apart. ""It gave me a start professionally. Mary O\'Malley, the founder of the theatre, gave me my future. ""In those days, in the mid-70s, when I was there, we were doing a play every four weeks. ""Belfast was not a pretty town to be living in. ""There was serious trouble, as you know, but this theatre was like a Belisha beacon of light and hope six nights a week, doing everything from Shakespeare to Yeats to O\'Casey with a group of actors and actresses that affected me very deeply and still do."" The Lyric began 50 years ago but the doors opened at its present site on the Stranmillis embankment overlooking the River Lagan in 1968.\n\nAs well as Liam Neeson, it also launched the careers of Adrian Dunbar and Stephen Rea and playwrights such as Martin Lynch and Gary Mitchell. Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland before the event at New York\'s SoHo House, Mr Neeson said that his spirit belonged to the Glens of Antrim. And he said that there was one figure from his childhood that he would love to portray on the big screen - Ian Paisley. He said that the DUP leader and preacher was a ""very dynamic, extraordinary figure"". Neeson used to listen to his sermons on a Friday night in Ballymena. He said: ""What an orator. He was from that old school of bible-thumping righteousness. But it was so dramatic. I found him very powerful. ""I\'d love to get a chance to play him some time.""\n'",entertainment,entertainment
68,"b'Split-caps pay \xc2\xa3194m compensation\n\nInvestors who lost money following the split-capital investment trust scandal are to receive \xc2\xa3194m compensation, the UK\'s financial watchdog has announced.\n\nEighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. But when the stock market collapsed in 2000, the products left thousands of investors out of pocket. An estimated 50,000 people took out split-capital funds, some investing their life savings in the schemes. The paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company, the FSA said.\n\nFurther details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year. ""This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome,"" Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News. Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added. Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\n\nThe FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. The FSA\'s 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called ""magic circle"", in the hope of propping up one another\'s share prices.\n\nFirms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27,000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to \xc2\xa3350m in compensation. Mr McIvor told the BBC that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.\n'",business,business

However, Lakshmi Mittal has told investors the combined company will have to shed thousands of jobs. The Indian-born magnate did not say where the job losses would fall.\n\nMr Mittal told US investors that once the acquisition of International Steel Group was completed, the company would aim to reduce its workforce by between 7,000 and 8,000 annually. This could see its workforce trimmed from 155,000 to 110,000 staff by 2010. ""We are investing in modernisation so employees will go down,"" Mr Mittal told the conference in Chicago.\n\nMittal Steel was formed last year when Mr Mittal\'s LNM Holdings merged with Dutch firm Ispat.

He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.\n\nTory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans ""stink"". He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would ""set out the position very clearly"" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could ""help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives"". He added: ""When the police say that you have to take them seriously"".\n\nHe acknowledged there were ""good libertarian arguments"" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the ""conflicting interests"" before reaching its decision. ""I don\'t pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken."" He also denied he was afraid of looking ""soft"" on the issue, compared to Labour. The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.\n\nSources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. But the Tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.\n\nThey said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people\'s privacy would be properly protected. ""It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,"" a spokesman said. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and ""deeply flawed"". He said: ""This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues\' concerns over ID cards.""\n\nThe chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the ""margins of society"" would be driven into the hands of extremists. ""What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven\'t [ID cards] they are going to be detained."" Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a ""regressive"" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. He predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of Britain\'s ethnic minorities being stopped by police.\n'",politics,politics

British actors in attendance include nominees Clive Owen, Imelda Staunton, Kate Winslet and director Mike Leigh. The Aviator leads the shortlist, but critics believe the night may belong to Clint Eastwood\'s Million Dollar Baby. A recent poll of US pundits found Eastwood\'s boxing drama had become the new favourite to win best film over the Howard Hughes biopic.\n\nIf the 74-year-old does win, he will become the oldest person ever to be named best director at the ceremony. UK critics still favour The Aviator for best film, but believe the best director title will generate a close fought battle between Eastwood and Martin Scorsese.\n\nScorsese has never won the best director prize, despite four previous nominations for films including Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Gangs of New York. Eastwood has won best director once before, for Unforgiven in 1993. Most experts predict the twice-nominated Jamie Foxx will win best actor for his portrayal of singer Ray Charles, while Vera Drake star Imelda Staunton looks likely to lose out in the best actress field to Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby. The UK\'s highest hopes remain with Clive Owen, who has scooped both the Golden Globe and the Bafta for his supporting role in Closer. Actor and comedian Chris Rock will host the event, which will be broadcast with a seven-second time delay to allow censors to cut out any unsuitable content.\n\n""We have the bleep machine ready, but bleeps will be used as needed,"" producer Gil Cates told reporters. However, he added that he strongly disapproved of the growing tendency to censor live broadcasts on US TV.\n\nHe also played down fears that Rock, who is known for using strong language in his stand-up routines, might cause controversy on the night. The 40-year-old comic has already promised not to swear live on air during the show. ""Chris has a sense of humour and everything he says is really said humorously,"" Cates said. ""You need a movie star and someone who is a stand-up comic so they can deal with the vicissitudes of the show."" Security will also be tight, with police employing a system to detect sarin nerve gas. ""We are pulling out all the stops,"" said John Miller, chief of counterterrorism at the Los Angeles Police Department. The show is ""a symbol of American culture and has the potential to be a high-visibility target,"" he added. Meanwhile, organisers have erected a canopy over the red carpet following an outbreak of torrential rain in Los Angeles over the past week. Cates said the covers would be removed if the threat of wet weather receded. Details have also emerged of the contents of this year\'s gift bags, which are given to nominees and presenters on the night. This year\'s bags will include a gift certificate for a luxury beach resort, a pair of mink eyelashes and a kitchen set with a year\'s supply of tea and coffee.

But he told BBC Sport: ""Michalak is the answer both now and for the future. Delaigue deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back Michalak. ""He does have weaknesses but has the all-round game to upset Ireland."" The 22-year-old Michalak has spent much of the tournament on the bench after Delaigue impressed for Castres early in the season. With Michalak overlooked, the French stuttered to narrow wins over Scotland and then England before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to Wales. ""The Wales game was amazing to watch but never did I think the French could lose that game at half-time,"" said Sella.\n\n""Their only mistakes were that they didn\'t score enough points in the first half and were a little bit less focused in the second... but only a little bit."" Sella, however, insisted the pressure had eased on the under-fire Laporte, despite the defeat at the Stade de France. ""This season is very important for shaping a team for the 2007 World Cup,"" said Sella, ""which Laporte is doing very well. The French get better every game. ""It\'s difficult, though, when you change a team and you change your tactics as everything has to gel. ""But he has the players and the talent to take them all the way to World Cup victory. ""As a result, it is important that people give him time. It may not seem good now that we\'re not winning the Grand Slam but no one will care in two years time if we\'re world champions.""\n\nThe majority of media criticism centred on the way in which France produced a performance devoid of running rugby in their opening two games. But while Sella admitted he liked the more flowing style employed against Wales, he said ""the win was most important"". ""Winning is all that matters,"" he added. ""Ok, the flair may not have been so good, but the discipline, organisation and defence was there, which are all important ahead of 2007."" France play what Sella believes is their hardest game of the Six Nations against Ireland in Dublin on Saturday 12 March. The French go into the game as clear underdogs.

The IETF ensures the smooth running and organisation of the net\'s architecture. With broadband take-up growing, services like voice and TV will open up interesting challenges for the net. ""I think VoIP (Voice-over Internet Protocol, allowing phone calls to be made over the Net) is very important - it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms,"" says Dr Carpenter. ""Second, it challenges more deeply the business model that you have to be a service provider with a lot of infrastructure. With VoIP, you need very little infrastructure.""\n\nA distinguished IBM engineer, Dr Carpenter spent 20 years at Cern, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics. As the new chair of the IETF, his next big challenge is overseeing IPv6, the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web. At Cern, Dr Carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web, so he is well-placed to take on such a task. The net\'s growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols, and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is a crucial job of the IETF. The top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work, are open and free for anyone to use and work with.\n\nThe net is built on a protocol called TCP/IP, which means transmission control protocol, and internet protocol. When computers communicate with the net, a unique IP address is used to send and receive information. The IETF is a large international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers working on the evolution of the net\'s architecture and the way this information is sent and received. They make sure it all knits together leaving no gaps. ""We\'ve seen some interesting effects over last few years,"" explains Dr Carpenter. ""The net was growing at a fantastic rate at the end of the 90s. Then there was a bit of a glitch in 2000. ""We are now seeing a very clear phase of consolidation and renewed growth.""\n\nThat renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies, like China, which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies. The number of broadband subscribers via DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) doubled in a year to 13 million, according to figures released at the end of 2004. ""The challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate,"" explained Dr Carpenter. ""Given it [the net] was designed for the whole community, it has done well to reach millions. If you want to reach the whole population, you have to make sure it can scale up."" IPv6, the standard that will replace the existing IPv4, will allow for billions more addresses on the net, and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world. ""The actual number of addresses with IPv4 is limited to four billion IP addresses. ""That clearly is not enough when you have 10 billion people to serve, so there is technical solution, the new version of IP - IPv6. ""It has much larger address space possibilities with no practical limits,"" said Dr Carpenter. Standards are vital to something as complex as the net, and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is a big task. The difference this next generation standard, IPv6, will make to the average net user is almost invisible. ""Our first goal is that it [IPv6] should make no difference - people should not notice a difference. ""It is like when the London telephone numbers got longer. A lot of the process will be invisible. ""People are usually given an IP address without knowing it."" Technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled, said Dr Carpenter.\n\nThe one problem with the net that may never disappear completely is security. To Dr Carpenter, the solution comes out of technological and human behaviour. People have to be educated about ""sensible behaviour"" he says, such as ignoring e-mails that claim you have won something.\n\n""I don\'t think it is going to get worse. People will remain concerned about security and they probably should do - just as you would be concerned walking along a dark street. ""We have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards. It is a never-ending battle in a sense."" But, he adds: ""Even if security has improved, you still worry a bit. Unfortunately, it is just part of life. We have a duty to do what we can.""\n'",tech,tech
77,"b'Jones happy with Henson heroics\n\nWales fly-half Stephen Jones admitted he was happy to hand Gavin Henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against England.\n\nJones had missed three earlier shots at goal when Wales, 9-8 down, were awarded a long-range penalty with four minutes left in Cardiff. ""I knew the percentages of Gavin reaching it were far higher than me,"" Jones said. ""When he said he wanted it, there were no problems."" Jones had seen a long-range effort fall a whisker under the crossbar on the hour, before Charlie Hodgson put England in front with 10 minutes left. ""I looked at where it was and I knew I was going to struggle to make it,"" Jones added. ""I said to Gareth (Thomas, the Wales captain) \'This is touch and go.\' It was out of my range and obviously Gavin is phenomenal when it comes to distance. He was confident and fancied it. ""There were no questions that he\'d miss it the way he was playing. He had a superb game."" Jones was happy to hail Henson\'s heroic contribution to Wales\' first win over England in Cardiff since 1993. ""Physically he\'s a specimen: he\'s a balanced player, he glides when he runs and obviously he\'s got a great kicking game as well,"" Jones said.\n\n""His defence was superb, he made some great hits and he had a great game. ""I\'m glad he\'s Welsh."" Victory over England for the first time since 1999 will no doubt fuel expectations of what Wales might achieve in this year\'s Six Nations. But they now face three away fixtures in Italy, France and Scotland before completing their campaign against Ireland in Cardiff. ""People all over the world want to see Wales back at the top table of world rugby,"" said a proud coach Mike Ruddock. ""But we are not there yet. The next step is finding the consistency to get further wins. ""We have to travel this week and we can\'t afford to get too giddy about this result. ""We have got to be professional and keep focused on facing Italy.""\n\nNone more so than Henson, who can now expect to have the same sort of spotlight thrust upon him as the likes of Jonny Wilkinson and Brian O\'Driscoll. The confident 23-year-old is undaunted by the prospect of dealing with such weighty expectations however. ""I\'m the sort of player who likes pressure on me,"" he said. ""It makes me more concentrated and I think I perform better under more pressure. ""I set a high standard against England and I\'ve got to back it up next week. ""Two years ago when we played Italy I wasn\'t involved and we lost, so we\'ve got to put that right next week.""\n'",sport,sport

Ronaldino wasted a second-half chance to equalise for Barca when he put a penalty wide, but Torres made no such mistake with a last-minute spot-kick. The defeat, coupled with Real Madrid's 4-0 win over Espanyol on Saturday, reduces Barca's lead to four points. Former Everton midfielder Thomas Gravesen scored his first goal for Real in the comfortable victory at the Bernabeu. Zinedine Zidane had opened the scoring before Raul bagged a brace. Gravesen, who replaced Zidane, completed the scoring in the 84th minute with a low shot. David Beckham, watched by Sven-Goran Eriksson, came off in the 67th minute with a shoulder injury but should be fit for England's game against Holland. England team-mate Michael Owen came on for Raul after 76 minutes with the game already won.

79,"b'GM in crunch talks on Fiat future\n\nFiat will meet car giant General Motors (GM) on Tuesday in an attempt to reach agreement over the future of the Italian firm\'s loss-making auto group.\n\nFiat claims that GM is legally obliged to buy the 90% of the car unit it does not already own; GM says the contract, signed in 2000, is no longer valid. Press reports have speculated that Fiat may be willing to accept a cash payment in return for dropping its claim. Both companies want to cut costs as the car industry adjusts to waning demand.\n\nThe meeting between Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne and GM\'s Rick Wagoner is due to take place at 1330 GMT in Zurich, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nMr Marchionne is confident of his firm\'s legal position, saying in an interview with the Financial Times that GM\'s argument ""has no legs"". The agreement in question dates back to GM\'s decision to buy 20% of Fiat\'s auto division in 2000. At the time, it gave the Italian firm the right, via a \'put option\', to sell the remaining stake to GM. In recent weeks, Fiat has reiterated its claims that this \'put\' is still valid and legally binding. However, GM argues that a Fiat share sale made last year, which cut GM\'s holding to 10%, together with asset sales made by Fiat have terminated the agreement.\n\nSelling the Fiat\'s car-making unit may not prove so simple, analysts say, especially as it is a company that is so closely linked to Italy\'s industrial heritage. Political and public pressure may well push the two firms to reach a compromise. ""We are not expecting Fiat to exercise its put of the auto business against an unwilling GM at this point,"" brokerage Merrill Lynch said in a note to investors, adding that any legal battle would be protracted and damaging to the business. ""As far as we are aware, the Agnelli family, which indirectly controls at least 30% of Fiat, has not given a firm public indication that it wants to sell the auto business. ""Fiat may be willing to cancel the \'put\' in exchange for money.""\n'",business,business
80,"b'Tautou film tops Cesar prize nods\n\nFrench film A Very Long Engagement has received 12 nominations for France\'s Cesar film awards, despite a recent ruling it was ""not French enough"".\n\nThe World War I romantic drama starring Audrey Tautou, was recently ruled ""too American"" by a Paris court as it was partially backed by Warner Bros. But the Cesar organisers modified their rules to allow the film to compete. The film, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, received best actress, picture and director nominations.\n\nLast November a court judged the film was too American to compete in French film festivals. Two associations of French producers challenged Jeunet\'s right to French government subsidies, because Warner Bros was a backer. The ruling meant the movie - which was filmed in France and used French actors and technicians - was not eligible to compete for French prizes. But Alain Terzian, president of Cesar organisers, the Academie des Arts et Techniques du Cinema, said the changes in eligibility rules, which allow films ""of French expression"", were made three months prior to the court decision. Other films in the best film category include Police drama 36, Quai Des Orfevres, Arnaud Desplechin\'s Kings And Queen, Abdellatif Kechiche\'s L\'Esquive and France\'s number one film at the 2004 box-office The Chorus.\n\nBest actors are Daniel Auteuil for 36, Mathieu Amalric for Kings And Queen, Gerard Jugnot for The Chorus, Philippe Torreton for L\'Equipier and Benoit Poelvoorde for Podium. Tautou will compete against Maggie Cheung , Emmanuelle Devos, Yolande Moreau and Karin Viard for best actress. Michael Moore\'s Fahrenheit 9/11, The Motorcycle Diaries, Lost in Translation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and 21 Grams are all vying in the best foreign film prize. The awards ceremony will be held on 26 February. This year, Will Smith, star of I, Robot, Independence Day and Men In Black, will be given an honorary Cesar, along with French singer/actor, Jacques Dutronc.\n'",entertainment,entertainment
81,"b""California sets fines for spyware\n\nThe makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home PCs could face hefty fines in California.\n\nFrom 1 January, a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware. The legislation, which was approved by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information. Spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing PC users in the coming year. The software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information. At its worst, it has the ability to hijack personal data, like passwords, login details and credit card numbers. The programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate.\n\nOne form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer user's web-surfing. It can result in people being bombarded with pop-up ads that are hard to close. In Washington, Congress has been debating four anti-spyware bills, but California is a step ahead. The state's Consumer Protection Against Spyware Act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer. It also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware. Consumers are able to seek up to $1,000 in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software. The new law marks a continuing trend in California towards tougher privacy rights. A recent survey by Earthlink and Webroot found that 90% of PCs are infested with the surreptitious software and that, on average, each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs. Currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as Spybot and Ad-Aware.\n""",tech,tech

Open Water, Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State and Super-Size Me were all snapped up at last year\'s festival. But stars like Keanu Reeves and Pierce Brosnan also have films showing there. The festival is being opened by a screening of quirky comedy Happy Endings, starring former Friends actress Lisa Kudrow and Maggie Gyllenhaal, on Thursday.\n\nKudrow\'s Friends co-star, David Schwimmer, plays a divorced drunkard in Duane Hopwood, while Brosnan stars as a hit man in comedy The Matador. Keanu Reeves appears in coming-of-age tale Thumbsucker while Kevin Costner and Michael Keaton are among the other big names whose films are involved. Robert Redford founded Sundance in 1981 and it has gone on to showcase future successes such as Reservoir Dogs, The Blair Witch Project and The Full Monty. But it has received criticism that it has become more commercial and mainstream over the years. ""As much as the press argues that Sundance has completely changed, it hasn\'t changed that much,"" festival director Geoffrey Gilmore said. ""It\'s still a place for discovery. It\'s a place for common ground among film-makers and audiences more than it is the celebrity stuff."" Other films generating interest before this year\'s festival include Hustle & Flow, about an aspiring rapper, The Squid and the Whale, an autobiographical film by writer-director Noah Baumbach, and comedy/drama Pretty Persuasion.

83,"b'Jobs growth still slow in the US\n\nThe US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.\n\nAccording to Labor Department figures, US firms added only 146,000 jobs in January. The gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since September 2001. The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November\'s Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover. As a result, job creation became a key issue in last year\'s election. However, when adding December and January\'s figures, the administration\'s first term jobs record ended in positive territory.\n\nThe Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.\n\nAnalysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. ""It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,"" said Rick Egelton, deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group. ""We are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment."" ""The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,"" said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics.

85,"b'Nintendo DS aims to touch gamers\n\nThe mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of high-profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback. Market leader Nintendo, however, is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played.\n\nThe first striking thing about the DS is how retro it looks. Far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld, it looks more like Nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype. The lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens, and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree. Both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive. Nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen.\n\nThe Japanese gaming giant hopes the DS will maintain the firm\'s pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market.\n\nNintendo first launched its GameBoy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since. But its lead can no longer be taken for granted. Sony will enter the market later this year with its PlayStation Portable, while start-up companies Gizmondo and Tapwave Zodiac are also offering hybrid devices. ""We believe the DS will appeal to all ages, both genders and gamers of any skill,"" said David Yarnton, Nintendo Europe\'s general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. With its two screens, wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the GameBoy Advance, the DS certainly has a number of unique selling points. It went on sale in the US in mid-November priced $150 and Nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations, without giving detailed figures. Japan and Europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device. With more than two million pre-orders for the device in Japan, Nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot. But will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed? The game ships with a demo of Metroid Hunters - a 3D action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine\'s wireless capabilities. It certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people.\n\nThe game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim. The top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top-down map and the ability to switch weapons. It is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. Super Mario 64 DS is a faithful re-creation of the Nintendo 64 classic with a host of new mini-games and new levels. The game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine. One thing is for certain. Hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices, Ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers. If they manage to create titles which use the Nintendo DS\'s key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up. The fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks.\n'",tech,tech
86,"b'Lib Dems stress Budget trust gap\n\nPublic trust in the handling of the economy can only be restored if Gordon Brown opens up his books for unbiased inspection, say the Lib Dems.\n\nCity experts say there is a \xc2\xa310bn ""black hole"" in the public finances, a claim denied by the chancellor. Lib Dem spokesman Vince Cable said the public did not know who to believe and the National Audit Office should judge. Responding to the pre-Budget report, Mr Cable also attacked Labour\'s ""unfair"" and over-complicated taxes.\n\nIn his report, Mr Brown insisted he was on course to meet his ""golden rule"" of borrowing only to invest, rather than for day-to-day spending, over the course of the economic cycle. Mr Cable said people did not know whether to believe the chancellor or the consensus among experts which said the rule would be broken. ""There is an issue of credibility and trust,"" he said. ""We cannot have a continuation of a situation where the chancellor sets his own tests and then marks them. ""What we need is the equivalent of a thorough Ofsted inspection of the government\'s accounts."" He asked what the government had to hide.\n\nMr Cable also accused the chancellor of ducking tough choices. He argued: ""There are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt. But they have not been confronted."" Mr Brown confirmed he was setting aside another \xc2\xa3520m for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr Cable compared that new cost with the \xc2\xa3500m needed for Britain\'s role in the entire first Gulf War - when 80% of the bill had been met through help from European and Arab nations. He suggested keeping British troops in Iraq could cost another \xc2\xa31bn with the government also planning to spend at least \xc2\xa33bn for identity cards. The current economic climate meant Britain could not afford the ""reckless, George Bush-style tax cutting spree"" planned by the Tories, he said. Instead, what was needed was simple and fair taxation rather than the ""complete mess"" produced by Mr Brown\'s endless tinkering.\n\nMr Cable said 40% of all pensioners were now paying marginal tax rates of 50%. And one-and-a-half million hard working families were paying 60% marginal tax rates. With that record, he asked why ministers attacked Lib Dem plans for a new 50% tax rate for the ""very rich"" - those earning more than \xc2\xa3100,000 a year. Mr Brown earmarked \xc2\xa31bn to help keep down council tax rises next year. But the Lib Dem spokesman questioned whether that money was being found from cuts to education and health. He urged the government to scrap the ""grossly unfair"" tax completely. The Lib Dems want it replaced with a local income tax. In response, Mr Brown stressed the Iraq money came from a reserve funds. It was because he had rejected previous Lib Dem proposals, such as scrapping the New Deal, that Britain\'s economy was successful, claimed Mr Brown.\n'",politics,politics

However, the authorities have turned a blind eye to the many other firms selling insurance.

Creditors of Parmalat, the main operating company, are likely to see the percentage of debt they receive fall from 7.3% to 6.9%.\n\nSeveral former top Parmalat executives are under investigation for the fraud scandal. Lawmakers said on Wednesday night Enrico Bondi, the turnaround specialist appointed by the Italian government as Parmalat\'s chief executive, spoke positively about the company during a closed-door hearing of the Chamber of Deputies industry commission. ""Bondi supplied us with elements of positive results on the industrial positions and on the history of debt which will find a point of solution through the Parmalat group\'s quotation on the market in July,"" Italian news agency Apcom quoted several lawmakers as saying in a statement.\n'",business,business
94,"b""IAAF to rule on Greek sprint pair\n\nGreek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou are expected to find out on Wednesday if they will be banned for missing drugs tests this summer.\n\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) council held a conference call on Tuesday and are set to announce their decision. Kenteris and Thanou could be suspended for up to two years. The duo withdrew from the Olympics after missing a test but claimed they had suffered a motorcycle crash. The Greek authorities have also brought criminal charges against the sprinters for avoiding a drugs test and faking an accident. Their former coach Christos Tzekos is also facing charges and all three are awaiting a trial date.\n\nHowever, the IAAF will determine the sprinters' future on the track after carefully considering all the evidence. The sport's ruling body is expected to direct the Greek federation in what action it should take against the sprinters. Kenteris and Thanou can appeal against any decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The sprinters both sent written explanations to the IAAF, which have been taken into account. The IAAF sent an official warning to the sprinters and coach Tzekos after they were discovered training in Qatar rather than in Crete, where they had said they would be. But Kenteris and Thanou then went on to skip tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago, when they decided to fly back to Greece early. Just before the Olympics, the pair dramatically missed another test in Athens before withdrawing from the Games. Kenteris, 31, won gold in the 200m at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, where Thanou, 29, won silver in the 100m.\n""",sport,sport
95,"b'Howard attacks \'pay later\' Budget\n\nTory leader Michael Howard has dismissed Gordon Brown\'s Budget as ""vote now, pay later"" spending plans.\n\nThe simple fact was that under a new Labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole, Mr Howard said. Everyone could see the chancellor\'s ""sweeteners"", but these hid tax rises for hard working families, he said. Labour\'s ""faltering election campaign"" would not be helped by the package of measures, Mr Howard added.\n\nMr Brown\'s Budget was not about what was good for the country, but ""all about the interests of the Labour party,"" the Tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign. He went on to accuse Mr Brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other. He urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging ""millions of people in to the net"" to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax. ""We can all see the sweeteners, but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard-working families that are inevitable if Labour wins.""\n\nHe also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems Britain faced. ""Their only answer is to tax, to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later."" Mr Brown liked to rattle off ""magical balances conjured out of thin air"" in a bid to convince people there was no ""black hole"" in the nation\'s finances, the Tory leader said. ""This dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy Budget based on dodgy numbers,"" he said. ""You now propose to borrow, over the next six years, no less than \xc2\xa3168 billion; so much for prudence. ""The chancellor\'s forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime minister\'s forecasts of weapons of mass destruction.""\n\nMr Brown\'s council tax rebate for pensioners was \xc2\xa3300 less than what the Tories were offering, Mr Howard said. There was nothing in the Budget that would put more police on the streets, make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools. People would face a ""clear choice"" at the election, either ""more waste and higher taxes under Labour or lower taxes and value for money with the Conservatives"", he said. ""That\'s the battleground of this election. That\'s what this election is going to be all about and I say bring it on,"" he concluded, to loud Tory cheering.\n'",politics,politics
96,"b'Branson show flops on US screens\n\nEntrepreneur Sir Richard Branson\'s US TV show, The Rebel Billionaire, is proving a flop in the ratings.\n\nThe programme suffered poor viewing figures on its debut on the Fox network three weeks ago, and has lost one in five of its viewers since then. The show is seen as Fox\'s answer to The Apprentice featuring tycoon Donald Trump, a ratings hit for rivals NBC. Sir Richard\'s show sees a group of young entrepreneurs compete to become the president of his business empire. The Rebel Billionaire has averaged five million viewers and is 91st in the rankings of all prime-time shows. The Apprentice, which has already completed its first season, is still managing to pull in 16 million viewers, while its prime-time ranking is number four.\n\nBut Fox has said it plans to stick with Branson\'s show throughout its 12-episode run. ""It\'s going to remain on the air,"" said the network\'s spokesman Scott Grogin. ""Creatively we\'re extremely pleased with the show and hope the audience will find it,"" he added. Contestants on Sir Richard\'s show are confronted with business tasks to solve, similar to The Apprentice. They are also subjected to stunts like walking a plank suspended in mid-air. The Rebel Billionaire has marketed itself as a less materialistic version of The Apprentice, with Sir Richard shown jumping out of a taxi, while Trump is seen in a limousine.\n'",entertainment,business
97,"b'Bellamy under new fire\n\nNewcastle boss Graeme Souness has reopened his dispute with Craig Bellamy after claiming the Welshman was ""not good enough"" for the Magpies. Bellamy left Newcastle to join Celtic on loan after a major row with Souness. Souness - who refused to refer to the 25-year-old by name - said Bellamy did not score enough goals ""The chap that\'s just gone has scored 9.3 goals a season in his time in senior football - half of those weren\'t even in the top flight,"" said Souness. ""That\'s not good enough for a striker at a club like this. ""We need to have two strikers who are near 20 goals on a regular basis.""\n\nBellamy turned down a move to Birmingham in favour of joining Celtic after a disagreement about the Welsh international playing out of position quickly escalated. Earlier in the week, Souness had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken a hard line after Bellamy accused him of lying.\n\n""There are certain things you can forgive and forget,"" said Souness. ""But if I\'d been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job I have after Newcastle."" He could then return to St James\' Park - and he says that he wants to. However, it would seem unlikely he will play for Newcastle again as long as Souness remains in charge.\n'",sport,sport
98,"b'Kennedy to make temple address\n\nCharles Kennedy is set to address 2,000 people at a Hindu temple as part of an appeal to ethnic minority voters.\n\nThe Liberal Democrat leader will visit the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Temple in Neasden, north west London. He will say Labour ""can no longer lay exclusive claim to the votes of Britain\'s ethnic minorities"". Mr Kennedy will also highlight the anger among people of ""all races"" over the Iraq war and call for a ""balanced approach"" to tackling terrorism. Saturday\'s speech comes days after the Lib Dems launched their ethnic minority mini-manifesto. Mr Kennedy is to tell the audience: ""Many people in Britain, of all races, cultures and religions, were angry about the way we were taken to war in Iraq. ""And they saw the principled stand the Liberal Democrats took at the time.""\n\nHe will also say that the Lib Dems want to ""restore Britain\'s reputation on the world stage"" by fighting international poverty and climate change, and protecting human rights. Mr Kennedy will say that a ""balanced approach"" to tackling terrorism would mean ""tough measures to make Britain safe - but not at the expense of people\'s fundamental legal rights like has happened at Belmarsh"". He will say it also means acting through the United Nations on terrorism. Mr Kennedy held talks with Tony Blair on Friday over government plans to hold terror suspects under house arrest. He said afterwards that the Prime Minister had offered some ""movement"" to address his concerns. The plans face trouble in the Lords if Conservative and Lib Dem opposition continues.\n'",politics,politics
